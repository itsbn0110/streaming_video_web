00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:08,652
{\an8}<i>How did I survive that?</i>

4
00:01:10,946 --> 00:01:13,573
<i>It was some damn fall.</i>

5
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:17,660
<i>Oh, shit. My comm's busted.</i>

6
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:20,080
<i>My thermal's busted too.</i>

7
00:01:21,707 --> 00:01:25,210
<i>I should have got snapped in half
and died on the way down,</i>

8
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:28,588
<i>instead of slowly turning
into a meat popsicle.</i>

9
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:31,633
Timo?

10
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:34,803
Timo!

11
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:38,724
Timo, I'm down here.

12
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:42,269
Ow.

13
00:01:42,895 --> 00:01:44,146
Timo.

14
00:01:48,567 --> 00:01:49,943
Mickey?

15
00:01:50,277 --> 00:01:51,486
T-- Timo!

16
00:01:52,196 --> 00:01:55,449
- Timo, I'm down here.
- Mickey. Whoa.

17
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,327
You haven't died yet?

18
00:01:58,452 --> 00:02:00,244
- No.
- Hold on.

19
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:11,840
Oh, shit.

20
00:02:12,925 --> 00:02:14,760
Your flamethrower's still good.

21
00:02:15,427 --> 00:02:16,762
Not a single scratch.

22
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:19,764
It's a good thing I thought
to come down here.

23
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:21,682
Weapons will be happy to see this.

24
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:23,267
Hey, I'm gonna turn this in, okay?

25
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:24,895
I can take it.

26
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:28,857
You're not mad, right?
That I'm just taking this?

27
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:33,528
I mean, it's not looking very good
for you, right?

28
00:02:33,529 --> 00:02:37,866
- Also, line only goes this far.
- Uh-huh.

29
00:02:39,034 --> 00:02:42,037
Yeah, no, we-- we're cool.

30
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,999
You shouldn't have to take the risk.

31
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,044
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

32
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:55,133
Plus, they're gonna reprint you
back out tomorrow anyway.

33
00:02:57,094 --> 00:02:57,928
Yeah.

34
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:02,683
Hey, Mickey.

35
00:03:03,559 --> 00:03:04,393
Yeah?

36
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:07,437
What's it feel like to die?

37
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:16,154
I'm sure you're used to it by now.
Still...

38
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,288
How many times is this?

39
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:27,207
You're Mickey... 16?

40
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:31,461
17. Jerk.

41
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:34,046
18 after this one.

42
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:37,550
Well, it was nice knowing you,
have a nice death.

43
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:38,886
See you tomorrow.

44
00:03:42,264 --> 00:03:43,640
<i>Oh, great.</i>

45
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:47,144
<i>Why not?</i>

46
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:54,067
<i>That's a pretty big one.</i>

47
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:58,029
<i>Hopefully, I'll just get swallowed
in one go.</i>

48
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:01,407
<i>It's got to be better
than slowly freezing to death.</i>

49
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,867
<i>I guess.</i>

50
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:21,969
<i>Or maybe not.</i>

51
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:39,445
<i>But they just
printed me out again</i>

52
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:41,155
<i>every time I died.</i>

53
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:44,993
<i>All my data is saved,
and I just get a whole new body.</i>

54
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:49,539
<i>They do all this, kind of,
regular uploads of memories</i>

55
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,791
<i>and my personality traits...</i>

56
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:56,046
<i>...and re-implant it back in my brain.</i>

57
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:58,339
<i>That's some crazy technology, man.</i>

58
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:01,551
<i>Let's just say it's-- it's advanced.</i>

59
00:05:01,552 --> 00:05:03,387
<i>It's very advanced.</i>

60
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:10,351
Yes.

61
00:05:10,352 --> 00:05:11,978
Oh, come on, come on.

62
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:14,480
Wait. Would you just hold on a second?

63
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:16,399
Just like-- Calm down. Calm down.

64
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,484
Just relax, breathe.
That's right, breathe.

65
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:19,945
- Oh!
- Yes!

66
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,907
<i>The whole body printing
and memory transplanting thing,</i>

67
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:28,452
<i>to be honest, was so ridiculously
ahead of its time,</i>

68
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:32,331
<i>that it caused so many, like,
ethical fights</i>

69
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,208
<i>and religious blah, blah, blah,</i>

70
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:37,171
<i>that it was actually banned on Earth,</i>

71
00:05:37,296 --> 00:05:41,465
<i>and they only allow it now
in outer space for Expendables.</i>

72
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:43,009
<i>Like me.</i>

73
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:44,969
<i>So, from the second
we left the atmosphere,</i>

74
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:48,431
<i>they made me work my ass off
all the way to this planet.</i>

75
00:05:48,432 --> 00:05:50,767
<i>Gave me one mission after another.</i>

76
00:05:51,894 --> 00:05:56,732
Uh, Tech, what's going on?
The extra cable's here already.

77
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:59,276
<i>Um, the thing is, Mickey...</i>

78
00:06:00,444 --> 00:06:02,362
<i>Hey, Medical, you wanna tell him?</i>

79
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,072
Tell me what?

80
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:06,866
<i>Hi, Mickey. How're you doing?</i>

81
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:09,870
<i>Are you experiencing any vertigo,
nausea or dizziness?</i>

82
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:14,373
Uh, I-I guess I am feeling
a little dizzy.

83
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,960
<i>It's only gonna get worse
from here, Mickey,</i>

84
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:18,878
<i>with a nice fever too.</i>

85
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:22,465
<i>Truth is, you're exposed to unthinkable
levels of radiation right now,</i>

86
00:06:22,466 --> 00:06:25,384
<i>which is why we sent you out
in the first place.</i>

87
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:26,636
Okay.

88
00:06:26,637 --> 00:06:28,930
<i>If you could give us
a full description of your symptoms.</i>

89
00:06:28,931 --> 00:06:31,682
<i>So, a couple things I wanna go through</i>

90
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:34,143
<i>on our cosmic radiation checklist first.</i>

91
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:37,313
<i>How long until your skin starts to burn?</i>

92
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:40,358
<i>Then, how long until you go blind?</i>

93
00:06:40,359 --> 00:06:42,777
<i>And of course, how long until you die?</i>

94
00:06:42,778 --> 00:06:46,156
<i>That's the real nut we're after.</i>

95
00:06:48,951 --> 00:06:52,328
<i>There was this one time
in my fourth grade science class,</i>

96
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:54,665
<i>I messed with a lab frog.</i>

97
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:58,502
<i>I just figured
this all must be my punishment.</i>

98
00:06:59,962 --> 00:07:02,004
<i>Mickey, take off your glove,</i>

99
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:04,716
<i>so I can see what's happening
under your space suit.</i>

100
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:19,272
<i>Oh! Oh! Wow! Did you see that?</i>

101
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:49,468
Good morning.

102
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,345
Keep yourself hydrated, Mickey.

103
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:53,431
You'll start to feel extremely parched.

104
00:07:53,432 --> 00:07:55,808
Arkady, I think the dose was too high.

105
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:58,352
Who cares, Dorothy?
He's gonna be dead in ten minutes.

106
00:07:58,353 --> 00:08:00,104
Just focus on getting
all the blood samples.

107
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:02,816
He's gonna bleed through his eyes,
nose, mouth, ears, and rectum.

108
00:08:03,734 --> 00:08:07,403
Make sure to collect separate samples
from every hole. Okay?

109
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:10,323
And keep the memory upload going
at the same time.

110
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:14,452
This Mickey's special,
you know that, right?

111
00:08:14,453 --> 00:08:17,623
Out of all the Mickeys,
you will have the shortest lifespan.

112
00:08:18,582 --> 00:08:22,127
- I heard. Ten minutes.
- Well--

113
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:26,756
Actually, good news, it's more like 15.

114
00:08:26,757 --> 00:08:29,675
Much better, isn't it?

115
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:31,552
<i>I would have been
filthy rich by now</i>

116
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:32,803
<i>with life insurance, except...</i>

117
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:36,766
<i>...obviously,
Expendables are uninsurable.</i>

118
00:08:36,767 --> 00:08:41,230
<i>There's no workers' comp,
no unions, no pension benefits.</i>

119
00:08:41,897 --> 00:08:44,982
<i>Now, I wouldn't be surprised
if you were thinking at this point,</i>

120
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:48,028
<i>"Well then, why-- why did you
do this to yourself?"</i>

121
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:51,948
<i>Well, because I had a friend who told me</i>

122
00:08:51,949 --> 00:08:56,537
<i>that one day macarons
would sell better than burgers.</i>

123
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:02,875
{\an8}<i>And because I trusted this shitty friend,
and I got an enormous loan</i>

124
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:07,631
{\an8}<i>from a wonderful gentleman
to open a macaron store.</i>

125
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:22,228
Oh, shit.

126
00:09:40,414 --> 00:09:42,498
All right, all right,

127
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:43,834
calm down.

128
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:46,420
I'm well aware
that you have four weeks left.

129
00:09:46,545 --> 00:09:48,714
Just think of this as a little field trip.

130
00:09:48,964 --> 00:09:50,673
A taste of what may unfold

131
00:09:50,674 --> 00:09:53,176
should you fail to reimburse us
in a timely manner.

132
00:09:53,177 --> 00:09:56,470
{\an8}Besides, you two have
a lot of time on your hands,

133
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:59,974
{\an8}with your little macaron shop gone under.

134
00:09:59,975 --> 00:10:02,935
This is quite a show
you got on here for me, quite a show.

135
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:05,313
The message is clear, I hear you.
I hear it loud and clear,

136
00:10:05,314 --> 00:10:06,731
"I'm late. I'm late. The money is late."

137
00:10:06,732 --> 00:10:08,149
It's coming. Two people behind...

138
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:12,236
<i>Darius Blank.
A name I wish I'd never heard.</i>

139
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:16,073
{\an8}Mr. Blank isn't all that concerned
with money.

140
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:17,783
He has plenty.

141
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:20,120
This building's just one
of his many assets.

142
00:10:21,038 --> 00:10:23,289
Watching his delinquent borrowers die,

143
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:25,458
savoring the details of death...

144
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:27,669
that, he truly enjoys.

145
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:30,004
The message is clear. You can stop now.
We can stop, you know?

146
00:10:30,005 --> 00:10:31,797
It's-- It's... I hear you.

147
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:34,217
You know, two weeks,
two weeks is all it takes.

148
00:10:34,218 --> 00:10:36,511
All it takes now.
A-A-And more is coming,

149
00:10:36,512 --> 00:10:37,845
there's more coming, more money is...

150
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:40,056
{\an8}More money is, is, is...

151
00:10:48,524 --> 00:10:52,568
We caught that gentleman four days ago
in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia.

152
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:53,946
Looks expensive.

153
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:58,616
Rest assured,
anyone who misses the deadline,

154
00:10:58,617 --> 00:11:00,869
we chase them to the ends of the Earth.

155
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:04,997
<i>So we decided
to get off of Earth.</i>

156
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:10,546
<i>Nothing was working out,
and I got no family relying on me.</i>

157
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:12,797
<i>So, I applied to the colony expedition,</i>

158
00:11:12,798 --> 00:11:15,800
<i>but there's, like, a million other people
with the same idea.</i>

159
00:11:15,801 --> 00:11:17,635
<i>Seems like the whole of this rotten planet</i>

160
00:11:17,636 --> 00:11:19,053
<i>was running away from something.</i>

161
00:11:19,054 --> 00:11:21,722
<i>I guess everybody's got money problems.</i>

162
00:11:21,723 --> 00:11:24,225
<i>But anyway, we had to get on this ship,</i>

163
00:11:24,226 --> 00:11:26,227
<i>because it was the last one of the season.</i>

164
00:11:27,229 --> 00:11:30,064
Waves upon waves of people
desperate to leave Earth.

165
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:33,442
It's clear anti-migrationists
are talking to a brick wall

166
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:35,778
when they insist on fixing up the Earth,

167
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:40,199
instead of risking lives
by migrating to another planet.

168
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,952
It feels like these passionate applicants

169
00:11:42,953 --> 00:11:45,037
are already off in space.

170
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:47,290
More importantly, this is the expedition

171
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:50,502
led by former congressman,
Kenneth Marshall,

172
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:53,462
who lost his last two elections.

173
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:55,173
Is this failed politician

174
00:11:55,174 --> 00:11:58,843
now trying to establish
a kingdom beyond the stars?

175
00:11:58,844 --> 00:12:01,345
Is it his fanatical supporters

176
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:03,264
who won him a generous sponsorship

177
00:12:03,265 --> 00:12:06,976
from a particular religious
organization and corporation?

178
00:12:06,977 --> 00:12:09,395
So many questions left unanswered.

179
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:11,147
Let's go and talk to the crowd.

180
00:12:11,148 --> 00:12:14,233
Excuse me, are you
a Kenneth Marshall supporter?

181
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:16,152
I am. I am, big time.

182
00:12:16,153 --> 00:12:17,862
I am a full-on supporter.

183
00:12:17,863 --> 00:12:19,906
I basically am the one and only.

184
00:12:19,907 --> 00:12:21,908
Are you from
M-Marshall's official channel?

185
00:12:21,909 --> 00:12:23,743
- I'm from EC 20--
- No way.

186
00:12:23,744 --> 00:12:25,620
So Marshall's watching this right now?

187
00:12:25,621 --> 00:12:27,079
- Oh, my God!
- You need to pick me.

188
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,291
I swear, please pick me.

189
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:32,461
You need people young
and healthy for the expedition.

190
00:12:32,586 --> 00:12:36,005
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
we have another mild sandstorm today.</i>

191
00:12:36,006 --> 00:12:38,549
<i>Access is now restricted to gate three.</i>

192
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:41,552
<i>Please visit our stand
for discounted goggles and masks.</i>

193
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:45,139
<i>Additional five percent off
with Marshall Pay, as always.</i>

194
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:47,725
The other expeditions wouldn't take me,

195
00:12:47,726 --> 00:12:48,768
but they're wrong, I promise.

196
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:52,355
I can fix toilets. I make gingerbread.
You gotta take me, give me a shot.

197
00:12:52,356 --> 00:12:54,732
Take us to the clean star,
Marshall and Ylfa.

198
00:12:54,733 --> 00:12:56,359
Take me with you!

199
00:13:02,616 --> 00:13:04,117
Expendable.

200
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:06,787
You're applying to be an Expendable?

201
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:08,622
Seriously?

202
00:13:10,249 --> 00:13:12,125
You read through the whole application?

203
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:15,586
Yeah.

204
00:13:15,587 --> 00:13:17,506
<i>I should have read through it.</i>

205
00:13:17,881 --> 00:13:20,132
<i>I mean, I didn't have
too much of a choice.</i>

206
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:23,554
<i>I don't have any bona fide certifications.</i>

207
00:13:24,555 --> 00:13:26,890
<i>I don't really have any skills whatsoever.</i>

208
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:31,644
<i>Then I find out Timo's already called dibs</i>

209
00:13:31,645 --> 00:13:35,023
<i>on a position for himself,
as a flitter pilot.</i>

210
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:38,026
<i>He only just got his learner's
permit a couple of weeks before.</i>

211
00:13:39,611 --> 00:13:42,613
<i>No idea what he had to come up with
to pull that off,</i>

212
00:13:42,614 --> 00:13:44,199
<i>but you gotta give it to him.</i>

213
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:48,202
Excuse me.

214
00:13:48,203 --> 00:13:51,622
Is there, like, some construction
going on?

215
00:13:51,623 --> 00:13:52,999
Sorry, what?

216
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,918
You don't hear like a...

217
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:58,422
...like a ch-chain saw?

218
00:13:59,381 --> 00:14:01,383
Uh, no.

219
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:04,343
<i>I wanted to get
the hell outta there.</i>

220
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:07,264
<i>Somewhere where the sound
couldn't follow me.</i>

221
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:09,725
<i>Far out into space.</i>

222
00:14:11,977 --> 00:14:13,520
You read through the paperwork?

223
00:14:14,021 --> 00:14:15,062
Yes.

224
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:16,898
You read it, so you know, right?

225
00:14:16,899 --> 00:14:19,442
This is gonna be a pretty extreme job.

226
00:14:19,443 --> 00:14:21,862
But it's also gonna be fun.

227
00:14:22,571 --> 00:14:24,488
I'll explain all the details.

228
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:27,825
<i>I got so distracted
by that smell, uh,</i>

229
00:14:27,826 --> 00:14:30,453
<i>the smell of this woman's hair.</i>

230
00:14:30,454 --> 00:14:34,499
<i>It was like it brought back
some far away memory, or something.</i>

231
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:38,212
That giant tank downstairs
is called a cycler.

232
00:14:38,337 --> 00:14:41,756
It takes organic waste produced
in the spaceship,

233
00:14:41,757 --> 00:14:44,759
apple peels, chicken bones, rotten eggs,

234
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,428
dead bodies, human waste, you name it...

235
00:14:47,429 --> 00:14:50,932
then it combines, refines,
and recycles them

236
00:14:50,933 --> 00:14:55,019
and sends a portion to this printer.

237
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:57,397
Raw materials for a human body.

238
00:14:58,190 --> 00:14:59,982
Once you die, and the Committee approves,

239
00:14:59,983 --> 00:15:03,195
it'll print a new version of your body
within 20 hours.

240
00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:07,658
Take your clothes off, change into this.

241
00:15:09,201 --> 00:15:11,327
<i>I couldn't even hear
anything she was saying.</i>

242
00:15:11,328 --> 00:15:15,666
<i>It was like all of my senses
were focused on my nose.</i>

243
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:20,963
<i>Like, real déjà vu, but for a smell.</i>

244
00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:25,216
We're going to do a full scan
of your biodata.

245
00:15:25,217 --> 00:15:28,387
That means you'll be reprinted
exactly as you are right now.

246
00:15:29,012 --> 00:15:30,264
Forever.

247
00:15:31,181 --> 00:15:33,683
I better pop this.

248
00:15:33,684 --> 00:15:35,769
Otherwise, it will be there every time.

249
00:15:39,523 --> 00:15:41,023
<i>Well, I'm glad she didn't know</i>

250
00:15:41,024 --> 00:15:42,401
<i>about the one on my butt.</i>

251
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:49,365
<i>So, after she does the body scan,</i>

252
00:15:49,366 --> 00:15:51,325
<i>she uploaded my memories.</i>

253
00:15:51,326 --> 00:15:54,245
<i>Called it a "personality backup."</i>

254
00:15:54,246 --> 00:15:55,788
<i>And I gotta do this once a week,</i>

255
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:58,750
<i>so I don't have any big gaps
every time they print me out.</i>

256
00:15:59,042 --> 00:16:01,044
In the past,
you would have needed

257
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:03,754
a hard drive the size of
a commercial refrigerator

258
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:05,339
to copy an adult brain.

259
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:08,302
Now, this little brick.
Clever, right?

260
00:16:09,887 --> 00:16:11,554
<i>So, I was injected with some</i>

261
00:16:11,555 --> 00:16:13,306
<i>special solution.</i>

262
00:16:13,307 --> 00:16:16,143
<i>It brought back a flood of old memories.</i>

263
00:16:16,935 --> 00:16:19,229
<i>Too many memories.</i>

264
00:16:23,025 --> 00:16:25,360
<i>We were heading home
from the supermarket.</i>

265
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:27,905
<i>I asked to sit in the front seat.</i>

266
00:16:28,572 --> 00:16:30,239
<i>I said, "I'm big enough."</i>

267
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,701
<i>And that's when I saw the red button.</i>

268
00:16:33,243 --> 00:16:35,495
<i>I just pressed it and she crashed.</i>

269
00:17:08,487 --> 00:17:11,531
Put it to your head and pull the trigger.

270
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:14,825
This is the final requirement
to become an Expendable.

271
00:17:16,036 --> 00:17:18,204
Prove to me you have faith in the system.

272
00:17:19,957 --> 00:17:22,376
From now on,
you need to get used to dying.

273
00:17:23,001 --> 00:17:24,377
This is your job.

274
00:17:47,693 --> 00:17:49,902
<i>I began
the four-and-a-half year journey</i>

275
00:17:49,903 --> 00:17:51,196
<i>as Mickey 1.</i>

276
00:17:54,658 --> 00:17:57,452
<i>When you're stuck in a spaceship
for that long,</i>

277
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:00,247
<i>food is everything.</i>

278
00:18:01,331 --> 00:18:03,499
<i>Warning, Mickey 1.</i>

279
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,879
<i>Seven calories over
the current ration allocation.</i>

280
00:18:18,891 --> 00:18:21,601
<i>On that first day
in the cafeteria,</i>

281
00:18:21,602 --> 00:18:24,896
<i>I think I might have started thinking,</i>

282
00:18:24,897 --> 00:18:27,231
<i>"What have I done?" a little.</i>

283
00:18:27,232 --> 00:18:30,359
<i>The whole room was full of people
eating this crappy food,</i>

284
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:34,155
<i>and there's total silence, like,
you could hear a pin drop.</i>

285
00:18:34,156 --> 00:18:39,827
<i>Until, Kenneth Marshall
and his wife, Ylfa, walk in.</i>

286
00:18:40,913 --> 00:18:44,749
<i>And a whole bunch of people
just started going nuts.</i>

287
00:18:55,844 --> 00:18:58,763
<i>I was thinking,
"What the hell am I doing here?"</i>

288
00:19:03,852 --> 00:19:05,854
<i>But that's when I saw her.</i>

289
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,398
<i>Nasha.</i>

290
00:19:10,776 --> 00:19:13,612
<i>That was the first time
I saw Nasha Barridge.</i>

291
00:19:17,491 --> 00:19:20,118
<i>On day one in this long journey.</i>

292
00:20:12,713 --> 00:20:15,632
Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech!

293
00:20:17,718 --> 00:20:19,887
All right, enough. Enough.

294
00:20:21,388 --> 00:20:24,932
Keep that up for one minute
and you waste five calories.

295
00:20:24,933 --> 00:20:28,854
That's two percent of the precious meal
you're eating right now.

296
00:20:29,229 --> 00:20:31,480
<i>As you know, our number one priority</i>

297
00:20:31,481 --> 00:20:35,568
<i>is to conserve food resources
until our arrival at Niflheim,</i>

298
00:20:35,569 --> 00:20:38,154
<i>so that we maximize our survival rate.</i>

299
00:20:38,155 --> 00:20:39,740
So, listen up.

300
00:20:40,324 --> 00:20:42,742
Sexual intercourse, for example.

301
00:20:42,743 --> 00:20:43,951
- Each...
- Session.

302
00:20:43,952 --> 00:20:47,580
...session consumes
a whopping 100 calories.

303
00:20:47,581 --> 00:20:49,457
- At least.
- At least.

304
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:51,835
Depending on the participants,

305
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,463
duration times friction equals...

306
00:20:54,588 --> 00:20:56,923
The point is, Kenneth is talking
to the Committee

307
00:20:56,924 --> 00:20:59,800
about banning all sexual activity
on the ship.

308
00:20:59,801 --> 00:21:00,968
What?

309
00:21:00,969 --> 00:21:02,304
Well, I don't have a problem with that.

310
00:21:09,394 --> 00:21:11,938
Darling, are you sure this is
the right time to bring that up?

311
00:21:11,939 --> 00:21:14,608
Honey, I'm sorry.
I was just trying to help you.

312
00:21:17,236 --> 00:21:19,237
No. It's okay.

313
00:21:19,238 --> 00:21:22,073
Am I doing okay?
Should I go harder?

314
00:21:22,074 --> 00:21:24,659
- Yes! Yes, go hard.
- All right.

315
00:21:26,328 --> 00:21:28,621
Fellow pioneers,

316
00:21:28,622 --> 00:21:30,790
once we've arrived in Niflheim

317
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:33,125
and we've secured our food production,

318
00:21:33,126 --> 00:21:35,003
we will launch the greatest

319
00:21:35,128 --> 00:21:38,631
sex encouragement campaign in history.

320
00:21:43,595 --> 00:21:48,641
You will spread your seed
across the planet.

321
00:21:52,312 --> 00:21:55,648
First we survive! Then we thrive!

322
00:21:55,649 --> 00:21:58,110
Then we go forth and multiply!

323
00:21:58,485 --> 00:22:00,236
Propagate the species!

324
00:22:00,237 --> 00:22:02,738
We shall infest the land!

325
00:22:02,739 --> 00:22:06,618
Marshall! Marshall! Marshall!

326
00:22:07,619 --> 00:22:09,704
<i>And so we started infesting.</i>

327
00:22:09,705 --> 00:22:12,290
<i>With love.</i>

328
00:22:19,339 --> 00:22:22,008
And then, unfortunately, this is...

329
00:22:22,009 --> 00:22:23,467
Yeah. And now do this bit.

330
00:22:23,468 --> 00:22:25,219
Ooh.

331
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:27,763
- Oh, yeah.
- Come on, it's not that big.

332
00:22:31,476 --> 00:22:32,895
I'm sorry.

333
00:22:35,397 --> 00:22:38,065
<i>Those four years
would have felt like 40</i>

334
00:22:38,066 --> 00:22:40,401
<i>if it weren't for Nasha.</i>

335
00:22:40,402 --> 00:22:42,486
<i>She stayed with me in the best of times...</i>

336
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:47,451
<i>...and kept by my side
in the worst of times.</i>

337
00:22:55,959 --> 00:22:57,503
<i>Not everyone gets lucky enough</i>

338
00:22:57,628 --> 00:22:59,086
<i>to find a soulmate like this.</i>

339
00:22:59,087 --> 00:23:00,505
<i>None of this would have happened</i>

340
00:23:00,506 --> 00:23:02,423
<i>if I'd never boarded this spaceship,</i>

341
00:23:02,424 --> 00:23:05,551
<i>so all hail the great
loan shark, Darius Blank.</i>

342
00:23:05,552 --> 00:23:06,803
<i>Thanks, Darius.</i>

343
00:23:07,721 --> 00:23:09,305
<i>But it wasn't like I was slacking, though.</i>

344
00:23:09,306 --> 00:23:12,517
<i>I was super busy every day,
taking care of Nasha,</i>

345
00:23:12,518 --> 00:23:15,479
<i>and she's an all-in-one elite agent.</i>

346
00:23:16,605 --> 00:23:18,314
<i>And it's not easy supporting someone</i>

347
00:23:18,315 --> 00:23:22,151
<i>who's a soldier, a police officer,
and a firefighter.</i>

348
00:23:22,152 --> 00:23:25,446
<i>But what she sees in me,
I got no idea.</i>

349
00:23:25,447 --> 00:23:27,074
<i>I'm just grateful.</i>

350
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,784
<i>But as soon as I step out the door,</i>

351
00:23:29,785 --> 00:23:32,954
<i>the ship was filled with mostly...
dickheads.</i>

352
00:23:32,955 --> 00:23:34,498
Hey! Mickey, right?

353
00:23:35,999 --> 00:23:38,335
Can we just ask...

354
00:23:39,253 --> 00:23:43,006
Well... what's it like to die?

355
00:23:43,966 --> 00:23:46,634
You know, when you're reprinted?

356
00:23:46,635 --> 00:23:48,220
Yeah, how does that feel?

357
00:23:49,304 --> 00:23:51,806
Come on, just tell us.
We really want to know.

358
00:23:51,807 --> 00:23:53,432
<i>Imagine spending years,</i>

359
00:23:53,433 --> 00:23:54,684
<i>elbow-to-elbow with these bozos.</i>

360
00:23:54,685 --> 00:23:55,810
He won't tell us.

361
00:23:55,811 --> 00:23:57,103
<i>It was enough to push anyone
over the edge.</i>

362
00:23:57,104 --> 00:23:59,146
- "You'd have to kill me first!"
- "Over my dead body!"

363
00:23:59,147 --> 00:24:00,606
<i>Sometimes even Nasha,</i>

364
00:24:00,607 --> 00:24:02,441
<i>- who is a model citizen...</i>
- Over your dead body?

365
00:24:02,442 --> 00:24:04,485
<i>...would have to step in and remind us...</i>

366
00:24:04,486 --> 00:24:05,945
Over your dead body?

367
00:24:05,946 --> 00:24:07,321
<i>...that we were
all one big happy family.</i>

368
00:24:07,322 --> 00:24:08,489
Where do you think you're going?

369
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:09,740
<i>There to help one another.</i>

370
00:24:09,741 --> 00:24:11,701
<i>There to have each other's backs.</i>

371
00:24:11,702 --> 00:24:13,703
<i>A tight-knit harmonious community.</i>

372
00:24:13,704 --> 00:24:14,705
What do you say?

373
00:24:15,622 --> 00:24:17,206
<i>And the Committee has reduced</i>

374
00:24:17,207 --> 00:24:19,041
<i>Mickey 9's rations by half</i>

375
00:24:19,042 --> 00:24:21,378
<i>and assigned him
to manual cycler cleaning</i>

376
00:24:21,503 --> 00:24:23,338
<i>until further notice.</i>

377
00:24:23,755 --> 00:24:25,424
Congrats, man!

378
00:24:26,091 --> 00:24:27,301
Hey, Mickey.

379
00:24:28,177 --> 00:24:30,179
You must be hungry.
Have some more.

380
00:24:31,138 --> 00:24:33,807
Uh, thanks, Kai. Um--

381
00:24:35,809 --> 00:24:37,435
Do you change your shampoo?

382
00:24:37,436 --> 00:24:38,728
Shampoo?

383
00:24:38,729 --> 00:24:40,897
There's only one shampoo
in this entire spaceship.

384
00:24:40,898 --> 00:24:42,441
- Thank you.
- Okay.

385
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:45,401
<i>It was a very long trip</i>

386
00:24:45,402 --> 00:24:48,362
<i>- in a beautiful community.</i>
- Hi.

387
00:24:48,363 --> 00:24:54,745
<i>But, uh, Nasha was obviously
my one and only, you know.</i>

388
00:24:56,246 --> 00:24:57,331
<i>For real.</i>

389
00:25:00,375 --> 00:25:04,880
<i>And as for my one and only job,
I was proud of it.</i>

390
00:25:06,089 --> 00:25:08,592
<i>Felt like I was part of the team.</i>

391
00:25:10,802 --> 00:25:12,346
Matthew! Matthew!

392
00:25:13,514 --> 00:25:16,475
- I'm on the last level!
- Come on, hurry up!

393
00:25:17,893 --> 00:25:19,353
Quickly!

394
00:25:22,231 --> 00:25:23,564
<i>My brother travelers...</i>

395
00:25:23,565 --> 00:25:25,734
- <i>And sisters.</i>
- <i>And sisters.</i>

396
00:25:25,859 --> 00:25:27,736
It is long that we have come,

397
00:25:27,861 --> 00:25:30,321
four years together in this ship.

398
00:25:30,322 --> 00:25:34,575
And I, we, love you
like our very own family.

399
00:25:34,576 --> 00:25:36,536
And here we are,

400
00:25:36,537 --> 00:25:42,291
right below us awaits
our very own planet of purity.

401
00:25:45,379 --> 00:25:48,298
What the fuck is wrong with him?
He's so annoying.

402
00:25:49,466 --> 00:25:51,468
Maybe he has the flu or something?

403
00:25:52,094 --> 00:25:55,429
Like a virgin vanilla ice cream.

404
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:58,225
<i>Touched for the very first time.</i>

405
00:25:59,142 --> 00:26:01,352
It's gonna be really cold.

406
00:26:01,353 --> 00:26:04,189
Whoever's going down there first
is gonna freeze to death.

407
00:26:05,899 --> 00:26:09,485
<i>That's it, Mickey.
Deep breaths. Fill your lungs.</i>

408
00:26:09,486 --> 00:26:12,071
<i>Imagine there's
an unknown virus in the air</i>

409
00:26:12,072 --> 00:26:13,072
and you're sucking in

410
00:26:13,073 --> 00:26:15,700
every single microscopic
particle floating around.

411
00:26:15,701 --> 00:26:21,080
All the viruses fill every alveoli.

412
00:26:23,917 --> 00:26:25,502
So good!

413
00:26:26,628 --> 00:26:29,214
So good! Brilliant.

414
00:26:29,756 --> 00:26:32,426
<i>There really was
an unknown virus in the air.</i>

415
00:26:33,385 --> 00:26:34,803
<i>A lethal one.</i>

416
00:27:26,647 --> 00:27:28,982
Dorothy! Dorothy!

417
00:27:34,571 --> 00:27:36,782
Oh, wait. He's alive.

418
00:27:37,741 --> 00:27:38,992
So fucking what?

419
00:27:39,201 --> 00:27:40,619
I'm fine.

420
00:27:43,455 --> 00:27:45,123
Thank you.

421
00:27:47,376 --> 00:27:49,795
<i>In the end,
thanks to the lab rats,</i>

422
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:53,756
<i>Mickey 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16,</i>

423
00:27:53,757 --> 00:27:57,511
<i>getting stabbed, gassed, dumped
and burned, we got the vaccine.</i>

424
00:27:57,886 --> 00:27:59,930
<i>My great gift to mankind.</i>

425
00:28:00,889 --> 00:28:03,641
<i>And so, we didn't need oxygen masks,</i>

426
00:28:03,642 --> 00:28:05,936
<i>and we could see our breath
as much as we wanted.</i>

427
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:09,647
Look at that, Jennifer. Ridiculous.

428
00:28:09,648 --> 00:28:11,566
I can't believe we still live
in that thing.

429
00:28:11,567 --> 00:28:12,817
I know, right?

430
00:28:12,818 --> 00:28:14,861
Landfall was ages ago,
and we're still eating

431
00:28:14,862 --> 00:28:17,655
the same crappy in-flight TV dinner.

432
00:28:19,116 --> 00:28:22,827
Precisely why we ought
to build residential complexes.

433
00:28:22,828 --> 00:28:24,704
You know, grow crops as soon as possible.

434
00:28:24,705 --> 00:28:26,455
- Yeah, sure.
- You know, spread the seed,

435
00:28:26,456 --> 00:28:29,333
infest the land, propagate the species.

436
00:28:32,379 --> 00:28:33,797
It's freezing.

437
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:53,274
Whoa. Look at that color.

438
00:28:53,275 --> 00:28:54,775
- Yeah.
- It's beautiful--

439
00:28:59,489 --> 00:29:02,575
He's such a klutz.
You should learn some breakfall moves.

440
00:29:02,576 --> 00:29:04,452
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

441
00:29:04,453 --> 00:29:05,871
Come on.

442
00:29:09,124 --> 00:29:10,541
What's breakfall?

443
00:29:10,542 --> 00:29:13,045
Look at Kai.
Textbook perfect breakfall.

444
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:14,671
- Yeah?
- Shut up.

445
00:29:23,639 --> 00:29:26,308
Kai. What is it?

446
00:29:29,853 --> 00:29:32,063
Oh, God! What is that?

447
00:29:32,064 --> 00:29:35,149
Oh, my God!

448
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:36,192
Get it off! Get it off!

449
00:29:36,193 --> 00:29:38,444
Mickey!

450
00:29:39,613 --> 00:29:42,865
What the fuck, man?
What the fuck? What the fuck?

451
00:29:42,866 --> 00:29:44,909
What was that?
What the heck was that?

452
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:46,827
I don't know,
but there are more in the hole.

453
00:29:47,788 --> 00:29:49,748
- What--
- Let's get the fuck out of here.

454
00:29:50,749 --> 00:29:52,000
Come on, Mickey, let's go!

455
00:29:52,835 --> 00:29:55,212
Go, go, go. Move! Move!

456
00:30:02,511 --> 00:30:05,179
Jennifer!

457
00:30:08,725 --> 00:30:09,726
Thank you.

458
00:30:11,687 --> 00:30:13,772
Mickey. Mickey, it's Marshall.

459
00:30:15,023 --> 00:30:18,150
<i>You fucking useless little asshole!</i>

460
00:30:18,151 --> 00:30:19,569
<i>You're an Expendable!</i>

461
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:22,030
<i>You're here to be expended, damn it!</i>

462
00:30:22,155 --> 00:30:25,741
<i>And why is Jennifer Chilton,
a precious, fertile female,</i>

463
00:30:25,742 --> 00:30:27,535
<i>- dead and not you?</i>
- Come to my room.

464
00:30:27,536 --> 00:30:29,245
- <i>Honey, try this.</i>
- Leave me alone.

465
00:30:30,956 --> 00:30:33,624
<i>That's what I want to know. Disgusting.</i>

466
00:30:33,625 --> 00:30:35,460
<i>Really? You don't like my sauce?</i>

467
00:30:35,586 --> 00:30:37,795
<i>No, no, no, no, darling.</i>

468
00:30:37,796 --> 00:30:39,964
<i>- Those things, look at them.</i>
- The fuck's going on?

469
00:30:39,965 --> 00:30:42,300
<i>They're vicious, aren't they?</i>

470
00:30:42,301 --> 00:30:43,968
<i>Hungry's more like it.</i>

471
00:30:43,969 --> 00:30:46,305
<i>Hey, you! Stand still. Don't move.</i>

472
00:30:48,348 --> 00:30:51,602
<i>They lust for human flesh.</i>

473
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:56,606
<i>They're creepy.</i>

474
00:30:56,607 --> 00:30:58,399
<i>Oh, honey, that's perfect.</i>

475
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,525
<i>You should call them "creepers".</i>

476
00:30:59,526 --> 00:31:02,862
<i>I'll call them "creepers".
I'm calling them "creepers".</i>

477
00:31:02,863 --> 00:31:04,780
<i>Preston, are you listening?</i>

478
00:31:04,781 --> 00:31:07,241
<i>Expendable, I've decided,
and the Committee,</i>

479
00:31:07,242 --> 00:31:11,413
<i>that going forward,
your rations will be halved.</i>

480
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:13,706
<i>So, my shift doubled.</i>

481
00:31:13,707 --> 00:31:17,503
<i>Fourteen hours every day,
seven days a week,</i>

482
00:31:17,628 --> 00:31:21,255
<i>until I brought home
a creeper sample.</i>

483
00:31:21,256 --> 00:31:23,424
Timo! Timo!

484
00:31:48,408 --> 00:31:51,661
<i>Mickey, sexy chewy, your favorite.</i>

485
00:31:51,662 --> 00:31:54,373
<i>Chose it myself. Enjoy!</i>

486
00:32:13,851 --> 00:32:16,270
<i>How did I survive that?</i>

487
00:32:25,779 --> 00:32:27,990
Mickey! Whoa.

488
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:29,908
You haven't died yet?

489
00:32:34,329 --> 00:32:36,038
What's it feel like to die?

490
00:32:38,292 --> 00:32:42,087
<i>Even on my 17th
go-around, I really hate dying.</i>

491
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:46,508
<i>Still.</i>

492
00:32:47,342 --> 00:32:48,427
<i>Always.</i>

493
00:32:48,886 --> 00:32:51,054
<i>Every time.</i>

494
00:32:51,763 --> 00:32:53,848
<i>Bon appétit.</i>

495
00:33:04,651 --> 00:33:07,653
<i>Where am I? What's going on?</i>

496
00:33:07,654 --> 00:33:10,282
<i>I'm not coming out
of the printer?</i>

497
00:33:11,992 --> 00:33:16,079
<i>I'm still 17.</i>

498
00:33:17,372 --> 00:33:21,042
<i>Why didn't that thing eat me?
I was passed out.</i>

499
00:33:23,253 --> 00:33:25,088
<i>Did I not look tasty enough?</i>

500
00:33:32,095 --> 00:33:33,971
<i>Oh, God. It--</i>

501
00:33:33,972 --> 00:33:36,642
<i>It was saving me for the kiddos.</i>

502
00:33:37,851 --> 00:33:41,355
<i>What a great mom.</i>

503
00:33:42,481 --> 00:33:45,566
<i>Oh, please just make it quick.</i>

504
00:33:45,567 --> 00:33:48,487
<i>Come on guys, big bites.
Big bites!</i>

505
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,697
<i>Ow.</i>

506
00:33:51,698 --> 00:33:54,451
<i>Where are you taking me now?</i>

507
00:33:56,495 --> 00:33:59,248
<i>Has my meat gone bad
after all that reprinting?</i>

508
00:34:20,686 --> 00:34:23,438
Oh!

509
00:34:29,987 --> 00:34:30,986
Hey.

510
00:34:32,864 --> 00:34:34,699
I'm still good meat.

511
00:34:36,243 --> 00:34:37,953
I'm perfectly good meat.

512
00:34:38,911 --> 00:34:40,413
I taste fine.

513
00:34:59,558 --> 00:35:02,311
Ditching me out here
in the middle of nowhere.

514
00:35:04,938 --> 00:35:06,647
It's not cool!

515
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:21,622
Hey! Hey!

516
00:35:22,456 --> 00:35:23,332
Stop!

517
00:35:25,125 --> 00:35:26,460
Hey!

518
00:35:30,964 --> 00:35:34,259
Hey. Hey!

519
00:35:51,818 --> 00:35:53,277
- Whoa!
- Keep it coming!

520
00:35:53,278 --> 00:35:55,488
- Hey wait! Stop!
- Bring it in!

521
00:35:55,489 --> 00:35:57,240
No, stop!
You can't come through.

522
00:35:57,241 --> 00:35:58,824
- What?
- I said stop.

523
00:35:58,825 --> 00:36:01,327
- What's wrong?
- What is it now? Shit!

524
00:36:01,328 --> 00:36:04,539
Hey, look how big that rock is.
Are you blind?

525
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:06,749
You can't just have the authority
to bring something like that in.

526
00:36:07,668 --> 00:36:10,295
You think you can jam something
that huge through here?

527
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:13,381
Science requested it,
so don't give me shit about it.

528
00:36:13,382 --> 00:36:15,633
You try to jam it in,
and scratch anywhere

529
00:36:15,634 --> 00:36:18,052
on this gate, my gate, it's on you.

530
00:36:18,053 --> 00:36:20,888
On me? How?
Blame the guys in Science.

531
00:36:20,889 --> 00:36:22,265
They cut into the site,

532
00:36:22,266 --> 00:36:24,058
but I got specific orders
to bring it as is.

533
00:36:24,059 --> 00:36:26,227
Well, I don't fucking care, okay?

534
00:36:26,228 --> 00:36:28,437
They're in a meeting over there,
I can't reach them.

535
00:36:28,438 --> 00:36:30,064
I'm not taking the fall for this.

536
00:36:30,065 --> 00:36:31,357
Every time you come in here,

537
00:36:31,358 --> 00:36:34,277
my gate, gate three,
you act like you own the place.

538
00:36:34,278 --> 00:36:35,903
Why would I
wanna own this shithole?

539
00:36:35,904 --> 00:36:37,572
You should shut the fuck up, okay?

540
00:36:37,573 --> 00:36:39,073
You know what?
You need to get laid.

541
00:36:39,074 --> 00:36:40,825
Fuck you!

542
00:36:40,826 --> 00:36:42,785
Oh, damn, Mickey!

543
00:36:42,786 --> 00:36:45,079
Didn't expect to see you out there today.

544
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:49,918
Wait. Is that the time?

545
00:36:50,043 --> 00:36:53,672
It's 3:30?
That doesn't make any sense.

546
00:36:54,298 --> 00:36:56,048
That's right, that's it.

547
00:36:56,049 --> 00:36:57,800
Straight down, hold your line.
Hold your line.

548
00:36:57,801 --> 00:37:01,679
Do you remember--
Do you remember when I left?

549
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,055
- What did you say?
- Hold your line.

550
00:37:03,056 --> 00:37:06,851
No. No, no, wait, Buzzard.
That's not how you do it. Jeez!

551
00:37:06,852 --> 00:37:09,770
Shut it off at the mains.
The switch. Hey!

552
00:37:09,771 --> 00:37:11,856
No, no, don't. Stop! Stop!

553
00:37:11,857 --> 00:37:14,150
Shit! What did I tell you?

554
00:37:14,151 --> 00:37:16,111
Fucking shitbrain.

555
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:18,614
- Coming through. Line out.
- Hi, Steve.

556
00:37:22,534 --> 00:37:24,285
<i>It's that time again.</i>

557
00:37:24,286 --> 00:37:27,747
<i>The dinner of your dreams
with Kenneth Marshall.</i>

558
00:37:27,748 --> 00:37:30,041
<i>Who will be this month's
lucky guest of honor?</i>

559
00:37:30,042 --> 00:37:32,336
<i>A grand surprise awaits.</i>

560
00:37:32,461 --> 00:37:35,046
<i>Hang on to your ship,
because the dove of luck</i>

561
00:37:35,047 --> 00:37:37,465
<i>just might come fluttering its wings</i>

562
00:37:37,466 --> 00:37:39,551
<i>with an invitation for you.</i>

563
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:43,763
<i>From dove, with love,
over and out.</i>

564
00:38:23,345 --> 00:38:25,763
What is this?

565
00:38:25,764 --> 00:38:28,599
Why aren't you dead?

566
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,977
Oh, no. Oh, God. Oh, God.

567
00:38:30,978 --> 00:38:32,728
No, no, no.

568
00:38:32,729 --> 00:38:36,190
You're 18?
They printed you out today?

569
00:38:36,191 --> 00:38:39,110
What the fuck is going on?
According to Timo,

570
00:38:39,111 --> 00:38:41,279
you should be sliding out of
one of those creeper's assholes

571
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,363
right about now.

572
00:38:42,364 --> 00:38:44,491
Do you have to put it like that?

573
00:38:46,368 --> 00:38:48,287
Oh, God. I'm completely fucked.

574
00:38:48,745 --> 00:38:50,205
What do you mean?

575
00:38:52,541 --> 00:38:54,042
We're Multiples.

576
00:39:01,884 --> 00:39:05,304
I gotta kill you.

577
00:39:05,846 --> 00:39:08,514
Kill me?

578
00:39:08,515 --> 00:39:12,018
I mean, you should probably kill yourself
if one of us has to die.

579
00:39:12,019 --> 00:39:17,691
It's been, like,
two hours since I was printed.

580
00:39:19,443 --> 00:39:20,902
I've barely had a life.

581
00:39:20,903 --> 00:39:23,821
Well, I was never dead,
so you don't count.

582
00:39:23,822 --> 00:39:25,449
Go back to the cycler!

583
00:39:29,411 --> 00:39:33,414
<i>Multiples.
Where do I even begin?</i>

584
00:39:33,415 --> 00:39:35,500
Mankind is not equipped to deal with

585
00:39:35,501 --> 00:39:37,461
the legal and ethical implications

586
00:39:37,586 --> 00:39:40,046
{\an8}of adopting
this human printing technology.

587
00:39:42,633 --> 00:39:44,258
{\an8}Please tell me,

588
00:39:44,259 --> 00:39:46,302
can any of you
honestly guarantee

589
00:39:46,303 --> 00:39:49,555
that the technology
will not be abused?

590
00:39:49,556 --> 00:39:51,516
<i>No one in their
R and D department</i>

591
00:39:51,517 --> 00:39:53,684
<i>could come up
with a convincing answer.</i>

592
00:39:53,685 --> 00:39:55,394
<i>But the real problem was that</i>

593
00:39:55,395 --> 00:39:57,480
<i>one of the brains
behind human printing</i>

594
00:39:57,481 --> 00:40:00,608
<i>turned out to be
a certified psychopath,</i>

595
00:40:00,609 --> 00:40:02,819
<i>Alan Manikova.</i>

596
00:40:04,738 --> 00:40:06,739
I think it's him.

597
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:07,907
Are you sure?

598
00:40:07,908 --> 00:40:10,785
<i>There was this series
of particularly brutal murders</i>

599
00:40:10,786 --> 00:40:15,289
<i>targeting homeless people,
and only one eyewitness account.</i>

600
00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:17,959
<i>But it matched Alan Manikova's
appearance to a tee.</i>

601
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:22,506
<i>The cops thought they had their man,
except Manikova had a sure-fire alibi.</i>

602
00:40:22,631 --> 00:40:23,714
<i>At the time of the murder,</i>

603
00:40:23,715 --> 00:40:26,259
<i>he was getting his make-up done
for a children's science show.</i>

604
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:27,844
...come and help me
with the red blood cells

605
00:40:27,845 --> 00:40:29,596
and the white blood cells, please?

606
00:40:32,516 --> 00:40:34,392
<i>But the cops had his number.</i>

607
00:40:34,393 --> 00:40:36,018
<i>When they raided Manikova's house,</i>

608
00:40:36,019 --> 00:40:38,896
<i>they brought two sets
of handcuffs and warrants.</i>

609
00:40:38,897 --> 00:40:43,150
<i>They were on to him.
Or rather, they were on to them.</i>

610
00:40:43,151 --> 00:40:45,403
Which one's Manikova Prime?

611
00:40:45,404 --> 00:40:46,697
You?

612
00:40:47,823 --> 00:40:49,282
Or you?

613
00:40:49,283 --> 00:40:50,992
<i>Yep, there were two.</i>

614
00:40:50,993 --> 00:40:53,786
<i>One for the murder
and one for the alibi.</i>

615
00:40:53,787 --> 00:40:56,414
<i>Manikova had printed
another Manikova</i>

616
00:40:56,415 --> 00:40:59,000
<i>without the company knowing.</i>

617
00:40:59,001 --> 00:41:00,919
<i>And so
here's a question for you,</i>

618
00:41:01,044 --> 00:41:04,839
<i>are they accomplices or did one
act under the other's orders?</i>

619
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:07,550
<i>Are these separate,
independent crimes,</i>

620
00:41:07,551 --> 00:41:10,011
<i>or were they one person
from the get-go?</i>

621
00:41:10,012 --> 00:41:11,971
<i>They only get half portions in jail,</i>

622
00:41:11,972 --> 00:41:14,348
<i>or do they get a full meal each?</i>

623
00:41:14,349 --> 00:41:17,185
<i>Police, legal experts, philosophers,</i>

624
00:41:17,186 --> 00:41:19,520
<i>everyone was stumped.</i>

625
00:41:19,521 --> 00:41:21,981
<i>But while Manikova 1 and 2
were both</i>

626
00:41:21,982 --> 00:41:23,858
<i>locked up in an interrogation room,</i>

627
00:41:23,859 --> 00:41:26,320
<i>another homeless man
was brutally murdered.</i>

628
00:41:27,988 --> 00:41:31,073
<i>Lo and behold, Manikova 3.</i>

629
00:41:39,541 --> 00:41:42,461
<i>I think it was
some cheap tabloid reporter</i>

630
00:41:42,586 --> 00:41:46,088
<i>who called them Multiples,
or some professor or something.</i>

631
00:41:46,089 --> 00:41:48,216
<i>Whoever came up with it, it stuck.</i>

632
00:41:50,093 --> 00:41:54,430
<i>And pretty soon the word "Multiples"
spread fear and contempt.</i>

633
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:57,975
So Multiples are an abomination.
They destroy the natural order.

634
00:41:57,976 --> 00:42:01,729
Each soul shall only have one body.
Right?

635
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:04,148
One soul, one body.

636
00:42:04,149 --> 00:42:07,985
The Lord, he only blesses
this one-to-one union.

637
00:42:07,986 --> 00:42:09,946
But former congressman Marshall

638
00:42:09,947 --> 00:42:11,364
does have a point worth considering.

639
00:42:11,365 --> 00:42:14,575
It would be a shame not to explore

640
00:42:14,576 --> 00:42:18,914
the potential application
of this advanced technology.

641
00:42:19,289 --> 00:42:23,252
I was happy to receive an
invitation from this committee.

642
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:26,254
{\an8}You were subpoenaed, Mr. Marshall.

643
00:42:26,255 --> 00:42:29,340
{\an8}Sure, sure. In any case,

644
00:42:29,341 --> 00:42:34,637
{\an8}I want to take this opportunity to speak
as an Expedition Commander.

645
00:42:34,638 --> 00:42:37,057
{\an8}Human printing is a sin.

646
00:42:38,141 --> 00:42:42,520
Multiples are Satan's work.

647
00:42:42,521 --> 00:42:46,232
However, I've been contemplating
how can we use

648
00:42:46,233 --> 00:42:49,486
this abomination
for our common economic benefit.

649
00:42:50,195 --> 00:42:51,780
I propose...

650
00:42:53,073 --> 00:42:56,576
a trial run of human printing
far from Earth

651
00:42:56,577 --> 00:42:58,578
under the strictest oversight.

652
00:42:58,579 --> 00:43:03,374
Limiting such individuals to
one per expedition, per planet,

653
00:43:03,375 --> 00:43:06,461
under the designation, "Expendable."

654
00:43:08,046 --> 00:43:11,215
Multiples, in the case of Multiples,

655
00:43:11,216 --> 00:43:15,303
we exterminate every offending individual

656
00:43:15,304 --> 00:43:20,725
<i>in totality, mind and body, all
for the sake of public service.</i>

657
00:43:20,726 --> 00:43:22,643
On this Niflheim expedition,

658
00:43:22,644 --> 00:43:24,270
all Multiples will immediately

659
00:43:24,271 --> 00:43:29,193
be arrested, executed,
and permanently deleted.

660
00:43:32,404 --> 00:43:35,157
<i>My head.</i>

661
00:43:36,241 --> 00:43:39,244
<i>What the hell is this guy?</i>

662
00:43:40,245 --> 00:43:44,165
<i>Nasha told me that
Mickey 3 was whiny and clingy.</i>

663
00:43:44,166 --> 00:43:46,292
<i>5 was, uh, indecisive.</i>

664
00:43:46,293 --> 00:43:49,962
<i>And apparently, 8 was pretty
annoying and kinda stupid,</i>

665
00:43:49,963 --> 00:43:53,175
<i>but none of them were complete nutjobs.</i>

666
00:43:53,884 --> 00:43:57,929
<i>Even this lunatic is scared
of being a Multiple though.</i>

667
00:43:57,930 --> 00:44:00,474
<i>That's permanent deletion.</i>

668
00:44:01,350 --> 00:44:03,726
<i>Trying to trash me in the cycler.</i>

669
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:07,981
<i>If one of us has to go...</i>

670
00:44:09,983 --> 00:44:11,985
<i>...it ain't gonna be me.</i>

671
00:44:40,556 --> 00:44:42,265
Half it! Half it!

672
00:44:42,266 --> 00:44:44,142
Half, half, half!

673
00:44:44,726 --> 00:44:47,019
- What?
- Half it. Half!

674
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:48,437
I'll half it with you.

675
00:44:48,438 --> 00:44:51,065
I'll half the rations.
We could split the workload, too.

676
00:44:51,066 --> 00:44:53,694
And we can take turns dying.

677
00:44:56,154 --> 00:44:59,240
And you're 18,
so you can take all even numbers

678
00:44:59,241 --> 00:45:03,786
and I-I'll just cover, like,
19, 21, and the odd numbers.

679
00:45:03,787 --> 00:45:05,664
Are you afraid to die?

680
00:45:05,956 --> 00:45:07,165
Kinda, yeah.

681
00:45:08,375 --> 00:45:11,336
{\an8}You died plenty of times.
What are you so scared of?

682
00:45:11,461 --> 00:45:13,964
{\an8}Until now, I died and...

683
00:45:14,923 --> 00:45:19,552
I was just born again, you know.

684
00:45:19,553 --> 00:45:23,472
It felt like it was mecontinuing on.

685
00:45:23,473 --> 00:45:24,433
But now...

686
00:45:25,809 --> 00:45:27,186
once I die...

687
00:45:28,437 --> 00:45:31,023
it'll be over for me.

688
00:45:31,815 --> 00:45:34,193
It'll be youliving on.

689
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:36,653
You get what I mean?

690
00:45:45,871 --> 00:45:47,372
I don't like you.

691
00:45:48,373 --> 00:45:49,958
You're such a little bitch.

692
00:45:50,792 --> 00:45:52,044
But I'm you.

693
00:45:53,337 --> 00:45:54,630
I'm not you.

694
00:45:55,464 --> 00:45:57,591
I'm not gonna live like you.

695
00:45:58,383 --> 00:46:03,055
I'm gonna kill you.

696
00:46:22,699 --> 00:46:25,744
What the fuck, man?
Are you trying to get noticed?

697
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:29,580
They don't even have cameras.
Take that off, dumbass.

698
00:46:29,581 --> 00:46:31,499
Amateur. Your first time?

699
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:32,917
No, no.

700
00:46:32,918 --> 00:46:35,879
This is the pure stuff, right?
Undiluted?

701
00:46:36,213 --> 00:46:38,340
Who do you
think you're talking to?

702
00:46:39,424 --> 00:46:43,512
This is pure, uncut Oxy.

703
00:46:44,930 --> 00:46:46,056
It's fucking rare.

704
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:48,891
You only get two Oxyzofol capsules

705
00:46:48,892 --> 00:46:50,685
in one flamethrower, man.

706
00:46:53,605 --> 00:46:54,689
What is that?

707
00:46:54,690 --> 00:46:57,108
I feel it.

708
00:46:57,109 --> 00:46:58,484
What are you doing?

709
00:46:58,485 --> 00:47:01,321
That's not a thing. Open it.

710
00:47:02,155 --> 00:47:04,241
Should we just kill that son of a bitch?

711
00:47:04,867 --> 00:47:06,367
- I was just joking around.
- What?

712
00:47:06,368 --> 00:47:11,039
Don't act surprised.
Your memories are my memories.

713
00:47:11,164 --> 00:47:13,207
The money he blew.

714
00:47:13,208 --> 00:47:16,461
That bastard put most
of the loans under our name.

715
00:47:16,587 --> 00:47:19,882
In Darius Blank's ledger,
we're the ones on the hook.

716
00:47:20,507 --> 00:47:22,467
That needs fact checking.

717
00:47:22,885 --> 00:47:25,303
Have fun, man.

718
00:47:25,304 --> 00:47:26,637
Let's kill him.

719
00:47:26,638 --> 00:47:31,267
Are you crazy?
He-He's, like, my only friend.

720
00:47:31,268 --> 00:47:34,228
Friend? Same orphanage doesn't mean shit.

721
00:47:34,229 --> 00:47:35,271
Wait, wait.

722
00:47:37,191 --> 00:47:39,317
Timo.

723
00:47:39,318 --> 00:47:40,611
Mickey, what...?

724
00:47:41,195 --> 00:47:43,112
Looks like business is blowing up, huh?

725
00:47:43,113 --> 00:47:44,656
What're you talking about?

726
00:47:45,532 --> 00:47:47,618
Another junky coming in.

727
00:47:59,713 --> 00:48:00,380
Timo!

728
00:48:02,591 --> 00:48:04,800
Hey! Are you mental?

729
00:48:04,801 --> 00:48:06,469
Wait until I get out of here.
I'm gonna kill you!

730
00:48:06,470 --> 00:48:08,639
The fuck is this?

731
00:48:09,348 --> 00:48:11,766
Come down lower!
You fucking idiot.

732
00:48:27,449 --> 00:48:28,450
Okay.

733
00:48:29,368 --> 00:48:32,078
Okay. Come on.

734
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:35,457
Mickey, help me.

735
00:48:38,168 --> 00:48:40,879
What is that? Why is it so red?
That looks hot.

736
00:48:41,797 --> 00:48:43,089
What are you doing?

737
00:48:43,090 --> 00:48:45,133
I want you
to have a go at dying,

738
00:48:45,425 --> 00:48:46,968
you son of a bitch.

739
00:48:46,969 --> 00:48:49,345
What?

740
00:48:49,346 --> 00:48:50,429
Come on!

741
00:48:52,391 --> 00:48:54,309
Stop. Stop!

742
00:49:06,655 --> 00:49:07,822
Oh.

743
00:49:07,823 --> 00:49:10,534
Is that Mickey?
Hey, what's going on?

744
00:49:11,535 --> 00:49:13,120
Mickey, what are you doing here?

745
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:18,417
Uh, Timo accidentally fell in,
but, uh, he's all right now.

746
00:49:19,293 --> 00:49:21,086
You wanna keep dealing, motherfucker?

747
00:49:21,211 --> 00:49:22,379
Watch what you say.

748
00:49:27,092 --> 00:49:29,511
What happened? You okay?

749
00:49:31,096 --> 00:49:32,471
What's up with your hand?

750
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:38,686
Just taking out the trash,
and I tripped into the hole.

751
00:49:38,687 --> 00:49:40,146
I would've been a goner
if not for Mickey.

752
00:49:40,147 --> 00:49:42,815
I almost became cycler dust.

753
00:49:42,816 --> 00:49:43,942
Hey.

754
00:49:44,276 --> 00:49:45,902
You all right?

755
00:49:45,903 --> 00:49:49,071
Told you to stay in bed. It's only been
a few hours since you were printed.

756
00:49:49,072 --> 00:49:50,615
Yeah, I should've done.

757
00:49:50,616 --> 00:49:52,492
- You heard the rumors?
- Huh?

758
00:49:52,951 --> 00:49:56,078
Some guy out there
is dealing undiluted Oxyzofol.

759
00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:59,248
What? That's crazy.
That's pretty messed up.

760
00:49:59,249 --> 00:50:01,042
Between us, Timo,

761
00:50:01,043 --> 00:50:04,338
a drop here and there before bed
to take the edge off, I get it.

762
00:50:04,463 --> 00:50:06,714
But the pure, uncut stuff
is crossing the line.

763
00:50:06,715 --> 00:50:10,176
Oh, yeah, absolutely.
That's bad.

764
00:50:10,177 --> 00:50:12,970
Nasha, take Mickey home.
I'll wrap up here.

765
00:50:12,971 --> 00:50:15,432
Yes. Thank you.
I'll see you tomorrow.

766
00:50:30,989 --> 00:50:33,909
Well, today I feel like B6.

767
00:50:35,285 --> 00:50:37,161
- B6?
- Yes.

768
00:50:37,162 --> 00:50:39,789
Flying Nasha?

769
00:50:39,790 --> 00:50:41,916
It's definitely
the right place for that one.

770
00:50:41,917 --> 00:50:43,377
What's going on with you?

771
00:50:44,169 --> 00:50:46,087
Mm!

772
00:50:46,088 --> 00:50:47,713
This isn't like you.

773
00:50:47,714 --> 00:50:50,092
B6?

774
00:50:51,051 --> 00:50:53,262
B6 was ours, Nasha.

775
00:51:01,687 --> 00:51:02,813
Mickey?

776
00:51:03,605 --> 00:51:04,897
Hey, brother.

777
00:51:04,898 --> 00:51:06,899
I was just headed to your room
to get you, but here you are.

778
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:08,359
Looking good, Mickey.

779
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:09,862
Yes, sir. Okay.

780
00:51:10,612 --> 00:51:12,530
You stand there. Arm around, please.

781
00:51:12,531 --> 00:51:15,741
Great. Good.
Uh, big smile, Mickey, would you?

782
00:51:15,742 --> 00:51:17,076
- Hold that.
- Yeah, big smile. Great.

783
00:51:17,077 --> 00:51:19,829
Sorry. Could you just stand--
Great, thank you.

784
00:51:19,830 --> 00:51:22,373
Okay, and action.

785
00:51:22,374 --> 00:51:24,458
Congratulations.

786
00:51:24,459 --> 00:51:27,462
This month's lucky winner,
the fortunate soul

787
00:51:27,588 --> 00:51:29,422
who'll have the privilege
of a private dinner--

788
00:51:29,423 --> 00:51:31,257
At the camera--
who'll have a private dinner

789
00:51:31,258 --> 00:51:34,093
with the one and only
Kenneth Marshall is...

790
00:51:34,094 --> 00:51:35,553
Down the barrel.

791
00:51:35,554 --> 00:51:36,929
It's Mickey.

792
00:51:36,930 --> 00:51:38,556
Great. Big smile.

793
00:51:38,557 --> 00:51:39,640
Smile.

794
00:51:39,641 --> 00:51:41,809
There. Amazing. Okay, cut.

795
00:51:41,810 --> 00:51:44,020
Now, Marshall wants you
to come ASAP, okay?

796
00:51:44,021 --> 00:51:46,314
He's got a whole feast prepared
just for you.

797
00:51:46,315 --> 00:51:48,983
The Lord is truly blessing you
today, Mickey.

798
00:51:48,984 --> 00:51:51,402
First, I need to go back to my room.

799
00:51:51,403 --> 00:51:53,530
You get to stuff
your fucking face, Mickey.

800
00:51:55,782 --> 00:51:58,826
<i>I bet that freak
is probably drooling</i>

801
00:51:58,827 --> 00:52:01,037
<i>all over my beautiful Nasha already.</i>

802
00:52:01,038 --> 00:52:03,332
<i>It's disgusting.</i>

803
00:52:03,457 --> 00:52:05,374
<i>What's even more disgusting
is that I'm drooling</i>

804
00:52:05,375 --> 00:52:07,085
<i>at the thought of the tenderloin steak</i>

805
00:52:07,211 --> 00:52:08,837
<i>I ordered for Marshall's dinner.</i>

806
00:52:10,797 --> 00:52:12,549
<i>This is so wrong!</i>

807
00:52:13,008 --> 00:52:14,926
So glad you seem
to be enjoying it.

808
00:52:14,927 --> 00:52:17,262
How's the sauce?

809
00:52:20,307 --> 00:52:21,891
Oh.

810
00:52:21,892 --> 00:52:24,560
Oh, sorry, sorry.
Please, continue.

811
00:52:24,561 --> 00:52:26,480
Yeah, yeah, Mickey. Uh--

812
00:52:27,189 --> 00:52:31,026
Listen, going back to everything
that happened with, uh--

813
00:52:31,818 --> 00:52:32,860
Jennifer.

814
00:52:32,861 --> 00:52:34,905
Yes, Jennifer.

815
00:52:35,739 --> 00:52:36,948
Jennifer...

816
00:52:36,949 --> 00:52:38,074
Chilton.

817
00:52:38,075 --> 00:52:39,826
I know, I know.

818
00:52:40,244 --> 00:52:43,496
When we lost our dear Jennifer Chilton,

819
00:52:43,497 --> 00:52:48,919
I may have gotten a little angry
and said some terribly unkind things.

820
00:52:49,044 --> 00:52:52,381
I know it's late,
and I want to apologize.

821
00:52:52,506 --> 00:52:54,715
He's always like this.

822
00:52:54,716 --> 00:52:57,718
Such an adorable man and then
suddenly he's all cutthroat.

823
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:02,182
Darling, I'm trying
to make it here. Okay?

824
00:53:02,850 --> 00:53:06,477
Sorry. You're still squishy,
fresh out of the printer.

825
00:53:06,478 --> 00:53:08,145
Continue feeding yourself.

826
00:53:10,023 --> 00:53:13,317
Oh. Anyway, we have
another special guest here.

827
00:53:13,318 --> 00:53:14,444
Hi, Kai.

828
00:53:14,945 --> 00:53:16,487
Sorry, I'm late.

829
00:53:16,488 --> 00:53:18,739
- You look very nice.
- Thank you.

830
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:19,824
Come. Come.

831
00:53:19,825 --> 00:53:21,660
- It's good to see you.
- Sit.

832
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:26,373
You okay? Emotionally?

833
00:53:26,832 --> 00:53:29,167
Yeah, I feel fine, sir.
Thank you.

834
00:53:29,168 --> 00:53:32,713
I'm glad to hear it, Kai.
I'm so sorry about Jennifer.

835
00:53:32,838 --> 00:53:36,465
I hear you were extremely close.
Your best friend.

836
00:53:36,466 --> 00:53:38,718
But I knew you'd stay strong
throughout it all.

837
00:53:38,719 --> 00:53:40,469
Thank you, ma'am.

838
00:53:40,470 --> 00:53:43,891
But we didn't invite you here
simply to comfort you.

839
00:53:45,392 --> 00:53:47,603
We've had our eyes on you, Katz.

840
00:53:47,936 --> 00:53:49,770
- On me, sir?
- Mmm.

841
00:53:49,771 --> 00:53:51,856
May I ask why?

842
00:53:51,857 --> 00:53:53,734
You're one of us.

843
00:53:55,819 --> 00:53:57,613
With your impeccable genetics,

844
00:53:57,738 --> 00:54:01,115
you are the perfect specimen
for the colony I envision.

845
00:54:03,744 --> 00:54:05,286
Well, thank you, sir.

846
00:54:05,287 --> 00:54:08,915
That's why the church,
I mean, um, company,

847
00:54:08,916 --> 00:54:12,044
has chosen me to lead this expedition.

848
00:54:12,169 --> 00:54:15,339
The Earth's beyond saving
with all its muddy people.

849
00:54:16,006 --> 00:54:18,466
But you, you're something special,

850
00:54:18,467 --> 00:54:21,135
and I'm creating a world

851
00:54:21,136 --> 00:54:24,013
on a pure white planet
full of superior people.

852
00:54:24,014 --> 00:54:26,933
Like you. And us.
Isn't that right, darling?

853
00:54:26,934 --> 00:54:29,852
- Yes. Mmm. It's his vision.
- My vision.

854
00:54:29,853 --> 00:54:31,562
- His sensibilities.
- Sensibility.

855
00:54:31,563 --> 00:54:34,607
But let's be honest,
with your medical records in hand,

856
00:54:34,608 --> 00:54:36,984
you ran to join our expedition

857
00:54:36,985 --> 00:54:39,112
instead of one of those pathetic planets

858
00:54:39,238 --> 00:54:41,197
where they plant microchips

859
00:54:41,198 --> 00:54:43,741
in their artificially
inseminated baby embryos.

860
00:54:43,742 --> 00:54:45,409
You really are the perfect candidate

861
00:54:45,410 --> 00:54:47,787
for Niflheim's
natural child birthing program,

862
00:54:47,788 --> 00:54:50,498
aren't you, dear?

863
00:54:50,499 --> 00:54:54,002
Mr. Marshall, am I just a uterus to you?

864
00:54:57,089 --> 00:55:01,551
No! No, no, no.
It's nothing like that, Kai.

865
00:55:01,552 --> 00:55:04,387
No, this man is not one
to objectify women.

866
00:55:04,388 --> 00:55:08,391
All my husband means to say
is he has very high standards.

867
00:55:08,392 --> 00:55:11,185
His only dream is
of a planet exclusively

868
00:55:11,186 --> 00:55:12,895
for a pure human race.

869
00:55:12,896 --> 00:55:16,774
That consumes real crops,
and real meat,

870
00:55:16,775 --> 00:55:20,403
and dinners with delicate,
delicious sauces.

871
00:55:20,404 --> 00:55:24,156
Oh, sauce is the true
litmus test of civilization.

872
00:55:24,157 --> 00:55:26,659
People who devour burnt meat
are barbarians.

873
00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:29,579
Do try the sauce, Kai.
Here, I made it myself.

874
00:55:29,580 --> 00:55:31,081
Oh. Thank you.

875
00:55:33,750 --> 00:55:37,212
But first, I'd like to say a few
words in Jennifer's memory.

876
00:55:38,672 --> 00:55:39,630
A prayer.

877
00:55:39,631 --> 00:55:41,717
Always ready for a prayer.

878
00:55:43,051 --> 00:55:45,511
Jennifer, when I first met you
at the cafeteria

879
00:55:45,512 --> 00:55:47,014
four years ago...

880
00:55:57,024 --> 00:55:58,567
You were...

881
00:56:00,694 --> 00:56:02,446
Dear Lord...

882
00:56:02,905 --> 00:56:05,532
Jennifer Chilton's one and only soul

883
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:09,703
was taken
from her wonderful friend, Kai.

884
00:56:11,079 --> 00:56:12,497
Dear Lord...

885
00:56:13,207 --> 00:56:16,709
- Jennifer Chi--

886

897
00:57:04,007 --> 00:57:06,717
Apologies, sir.
This is embarrassing.

898
00:57:06,718 --> 00:57:08,344
The cultured meat that he just ate

899
00:57:08,345 --> 00:57:10,680
includes an experimental
growth hormone.

900
00:57:10,681 --> 00:57:14,225
Obviously, it's still risky.
I'm so very sorry, sir.

901
00:57:15,310 --> 00:57:17,270
You're sure it's not
because he was eating so much?

902
00:57:17,271 --> 00:57:19,939
He was stuffing his friggin' pie hole.

903
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:22,608
No, not quite, sir. You see
the red rash on his neck.

904
00:57:22,609 --> 00:57:24,819
It's a side effect
of the growth hormone.

905
00:57:24,820 --> 00:57:26,821
- Ah.
- I'm so ashamed.

906
00:57:26,822 --> 00:57:31,200
I take full responsibility and
resign my position immediately.

907
00:57:31,201 --> 00:57:35,997
No, no, no, not at all.
I mean, artificial meat is crap.

908
00:57:35,998 --> 00:57:37,498
How are we supposed to improve it

909
00:57:37,499 --> 00:57:40,210
unless we fail upward to perfection?

910
00:57:40,335 --> 00:57:41,961
No. Arkady...

911
00:57:41,962 --> 00:57:45,090
...stand tall in your failures
like me, my friend.

912
00:57:46,341 --> 00:57:48,093
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

913
00:57:48,468 --> 00:57:49,468
Commander.

914
00:57:49,469 --> 00:57:52,346
So you are testing out
your in-flight TV dinner on him?

915
00:57:52,347 --> 00:57:53,764
In-flight TV dinner?

916
00:57:55,142 --> 00:57:57,895
Is that what the young troops
are calling it now?

917
00:57:58,604 --> 00:57:59,687
Excuse me.

918
00:58:01,982 --> 00:58:03,649
Are you in a lot of pain?

919
00:58:03,650 --> 00:58:06,027
I'm being punished.

920
00:58:06,028 --> 00:58:08,863
- What?
- It's my punishment.

921
00:58:08,864 --> 00:58:12,159
I should've gone to Nasha
and not come here.

922
00:58:15,662 --> 00:58:16,580
Ew.

923
00:58:17,539 --> 00:58:19,499
Dorothy, bring me Purple Joe.

924
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,668
Sir, you remember the special painkiller

925
00:58:21,835 --> 00:58:22,960
we've been developing?

926
00:58:22,961 --> 00:58:24,337
Yeah, Purple Joe.

927
00:58:24,338 --> 00:58:26,380
It's a quick fix
for injured agents, right?

928
00:58:26,381 --> 00:58:29,342
Yeah. Since Mickey here
is in such awful pain,

929
00:58:29,343 --> 00:58:31,886
it's a perfect opportunity
to try a little test, so...

930
00:58:31,887 --> 00:58:33,597
- Give it to him.
- Great, all right.

931
00:58:42,981 --> 00:58:44,816
Come on, Purple Joe.

932
00:58:46,777 --> 00:58:48,654
Okay, here we go.

933
00:58:52,407 --> 00:58:54,116
Don't touch him, please.

934
00:58:54,117 --> 00:58:56,494
Mickey, can you see me?

935
00:58:56,495 --> 00:58:58,829
Mickey? Mickey!

936
00:58:58,830 --> 00:59:01,083
- Oh, sorry.
- Get back down there.

937
00:59:01,875 --> 00:59:03,544
Mickey? Mickey?

938
00:59:03,669 --> 00:59:05,086
Oh, God. Oh, God.

939
00:59:10,384 --> 00:59:11,468
- Oh, my God.
- Oh.

940
00:59:14,221 --> 00:59:15,972
Oh. What do we do?

941
00:59:21,270 --> 00:59:23,729
Apologies, sir.
The painkiller's not working.

942
00:59:23,730 --> 00:59:25,189
Oh.

943
00:59:29,736 --> 00:59:32,697
Don't film this,
Preston. Please, turn it off.

944
00:59:34,449 --> 00:59:36,200
This is better, right?
More humane.

945
00:59:36,201 --> 00:59:37,285
Yes, sir. More humane.

946
00:59:37,286 --> 00:59:39,955
- No, no, no. What are you doing?
- Huh?

947
00:59:40,539 --> 00:59:42,373
You can't tear a hole
in my fucking carpet.

948
00:59:43,292 --> 00:59:45,169
Well, we'll just shoot him
from the side.

949
00:59:45,294 --> 00:59:47,086
But what about the blood?

950
00:59:47,087 --> 00:59:49,797
This is a Persian Tabriz!

951
00:59:49,798 --> 00:59:51,299
Honey, calm down.

952
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:52,259
Shoot now.

953
00:59:52,718 --> 00:59:54,552
What the hell is going on?

954
00:59:54,553 --> 00:59:57,389
This was supposed to be
a fucking dinner!

955
00:59:58,015 --> 00:59:59,391
He's your guest.

956
00:59:59,933 --> 01:00:02,810
Agent Kai Katz, what the hell's
going on with you?

957
01:00:02,811 --> 01:00:06,063
He's a meat matrix.
He's a goddamn print job.

958
01:00:06,064 --> 01:00:07,482
An Expendable.

959
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:09,859
He signed up for this.

960
01:00:09,860 --> 01:00:11,069
Yes, sir.

961
01:00:11,486 --> 01:00:13,070
This is for our planet, agent.

962
01:00:13,071 --> 01:00:14,614
I'm sorry, sir.

963
01:00:14,615 --> 01:00:15,865
Commander.

964
01:00:17,576 --> 01:00:20,704
Please don't shoot.

965
01:00:22,998 --> 01:00:24,416
I'm okay now.

966
01:00:25,375 --> 01:00:26,668
I don't think so.

967
01:00:27,503 --> 01:00:29,629
He still seems
like he's in a lot of pain.

968
01:00:29,630 --> 01:00:31,298
Of course he is.

969
01:00:37,638 --> 01:00:39,264
Are you really okay?

970
01:00:40,641 --> 01:00:43,100
Just... thank you for dinner.

971
01:00:46,104 --> 01:00:50,233
My room's just there.
You need to clean up and rest, Mickey.

972
01:00:52,069 --> 01:00:55,404
Don't worry about me.
I can walk.

973
01:00:55,405 --> 01:00:58,825
I just need to get back
to my room. Nasha's about to--

974
01:00:59,326 --> 01:01:01,328
Actually, we're going to mine.

975
01:01:17,302 --> 01:01:19,346
Here. It's dry.

976
01:01:20,722 --> 01:01:23,641
I drink this
whenever I have a stomach ache.

977
01:01:23,642 --> 01:01:28,689
It's from Earth. It's precious.
So I've been saving it.

978
01:01:34,069 --> 01:01:35,904
But I made some for you.

979
01:01:38,782 --> 01:01:40,576
- Thanks.
- Sit.

980
01:01:48,542 --> 01:01:53,380
You know, Mickey,
I didn't want to ask you this.

981
01:01:55,007 --> 01:01:59,761
But just this once, okay?
And I'm so sorry.

982
01:02:08,312 --> 01:02:12,274
What's it like... dying?

983
01:02:18,447 --> 01:02:20,157
You asking because of Jennifer?

984
01:02:22,201 --> 01:02:23,410
Yeah.

985
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:31,251
We locked eyes in the last moment.

986
01:02:35,422 --> 01:02:40,427
What did she feel as all that
ice came crashing down on her?

987
01:02:43,931 --> 01:02:45,933
I can't stop thinking about it.

988
01:02:50,062 --> 01:02:51,271
Um...

989
01:02:53,148 --> 01:02:57,069
I don't think it's what I--
what I usually feel. It's--

990
01:02:58,278 --> 01:03:00,239
Well, I die so often...

991
01:03:03,492 --> 01:03:06,078
Because you know you're
going to wake up again, right?

992
01:03:08,330 --> 01:03:10,374
Because you die knowing that.

993
01:03:15,587 --> 01:03:17,089
No...

994
01:03:20,509 --> 01:03:22,845
I always feel scared.

995
01:03:26,139 --> 01:03:31,311
It's terrible, dying. I hate it.

996
01:03:35,357 --> 01:03:40,654
No matter how many times
I go through it, it's scary.

997
01:03:42,990 --> 01:03:46,827
Still. Always, every time.

998
01:03:51,415 --> 01:03:53,083
But you're here.

999
01:03:56,170 --> 01:03:57,754
And Jennifer isn't.

1000
01:04:00,841 --> 01:04:02,134
Out there.

1001
01:04:03,969 --> 01:04:05,679
The entire universe.

1002
01:04:09,558 --> 01:04:11,059
She's nowhere.

1003
01:04:28,577 --> 01:04:30,913
You don't look like you were printed out.

1004
01:04:37,002 --> 01:04:39,004
You're just a person.

1005
01:04:45,010 --> 01:04:47,179
Are you and Nasha open?

1006
01:04:49,431 --> 01:04:51,225
I have to go.

1007
01:04:53,435 --> 01:04:55,896
Nasha, please forgive me.

1008
01:04:56,688 --> 01:04:59,732
The guy that you're having sex with...

1009
01:04:59,733 --> 01:05:01,943
...that's not me.

1010
01:05:04,404 --> 01:05:05,656
That's not me!

1011
01:05:06,365 --> 01:05:10,911
You motherfucker.
How dare you touch her!

1012
01:05:33,767 --> 01:05:35,060
17!

1013
01:05:37,563 --> 01:05:39,439
I knew this would happen
at some point.

1014
01:05:40,232 --> 01:05:43,819
Wait, wait, wait. Stand-stand--
Stand next to each other.

1015
01:05:44,486 --> 01:05:45,737
Wait, take this off.

1016
01:05:46,154 --> 01:05:47,154
What?

1017
01:05:47,155 --> 01:05:48,406
Yeah, I want you to look the same.

1018
01:05:48,407 --> 01:05:49,324
Mmm.

1019
01:05:58,333 --> 01:06:00,002
Oh, my God.

1020
01:06:07,593 --> 01:06:10,261
Nasha, uh, h-how can you
laugh right now?

1021
01:06:10,262 --> 01:06:13,014
This is a Multiples violation.
I'm-- I'm as good as dead.

1022
01:06:13,015 --> 01:06:15,933
Oh, come on!

1023
01:06:15,934 --> 01:06:18,811
When else am I gonna get this
chance? I mean, think about it.

1024
01:06:18,812 --> 01:06:21,689
You would be so psyched
if there were two of me.

1025
01:06:24,276 --> 01:06:30,281
This is "Mild Mickey."
And this is "Habanero Mickey."

1026
01:06:32,701 --> 01:06:35,245
This is so exciting!

1027
01:06:37,372 --> 01:06:39,333
It's so different.

1028
01:06:39,666 --> 01:06:42,628
Nasha, you're different, too.
You don't seem like yourself.

1029
01:06:46,965 --> 01:06:48,716
Oh, Jesus.

1030
01:06:48,717 --> 01:06:50,968
You just did Oxyzofol with him?

1031
01:06:50,969 --> 01:06:54,222
Just a teeny tiny bit,
with a ton of water.

1032
01:06:54,223 --> 01:06:55,306
Do you want some?

1033
01:06:55,307 --> 01:06:56,934
Yeah, yeah, relax.

1034
01:06:57,768 --> 01:06:59,268
Just take it easy.

1035
01:06:59,269 --> 01:07:00,603
Nasha!

1036
01:07:00,604 --> 01:07:02,438
This piece of shit
just tried to kill me earlier.

1037
01:07:02,439 --> 01:07:05,567
Right here in this room.
Look, I was bleeding.

1038
01:07:06,735 --> 01:07:09,070
Like you weren't thinking
of trying the same thing.

1039
01:07:09,071 --> 01:07:10,780
I saw you sneaking up behind me!

1040
01:07:10,781 --> 01:07:13,617
Hey, hey, hey, shut up. Shut up.

1041
01:07:14,284 --> 01:07:15,452
Now sit down.

1042
01:07:16,912 --> 01:07:18,413
Okay, attention.

1043
01:07:19,289 --> 01:07:22,124
From now on, I'm gonna feed
you both as often as I can,

1044
01:07:22,125 --> 01:07:23,961
so be good boys, and don't fight.

1045
01:07:24,711 --> 01:07:27,339
Now, 18 tells me you guys
have sorted it out already.

1046
01:07:28,507 --> 01:07:31,050
Eat half, work half.

1047
01:07:31,051 --> 01:07:33,512
Alternating deaths, evens and odds.

1048
01:07:33,971 --> 01:07:36,430
It's a great system.

1049
01:07:36,431 --> 01:07:40,310
Negotiation done,
so everyone just chill.

1050
01:07:41,812 --> 01:07:42,813
Okay?

1051
01:08:13,552 --> 01:08:16,138
Can you leave us alone
for a second?

1052
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:18,473
Why? What's the problem?

1053
01:08:20,975 --> 01:08:23,102
God damn it, I'm leaving.

1054
01:08:23,103 --> 01:08:28,148
Oh, you're such a baby.
This guy needs some Oxyzofol.

1055
01:08:28,149 --> 01:08:29,859
You can relax.

1056
01:09:00,765 --> 01:09:02,059
Is that the door?

1057
01:09:07,104 --> 01:09:08,314
Oh.

1058
01:09:16,490 --> 01:09:17,658
Oh, fuck.

1059
01:09:24,247 --> 01:09:25,082
Kai!

1060
01:09:26,375 --> 01:09:27,960
Wait up, let's talk.

1061
01:09:28,710 --> 01:09:30,503
And talk about what?

1062
01:09:30,504 --> 01:09:32,380
I don't care about your private life.

1063
01:09:32,381 --> 01:09:35,633
Okay. Fine. But what's up?

1064
01:09:35,634 --> 01:09:37,175
What's the rush?
Where are you going?

1065
01:09:37,176 --> 01:09:40,554
I just witnessed a Multiples violation
with my own eyes.

1066
01:09:40,555 --> 01:09:42,765
As an agent, I have a duty to report it.

1067
01:09:48,354 --> 01:09:49,857
Okay, fine.

1068
01:09:51,066 --> 01:09:53,443
But since when have you
been coming to Mickey's room?

1069
01:09:54,570 --> 01:09:56,530
This is your first time, right?

1070
01:09:59,324 --> 01:10:01,784
What's up with you and Kai, bro?
Why was she here?

1071
01:10:01,785 --> 01:10:04,495
Oh, man.
What are we supposed to do now?

1072
01:10:04,496 --> 01:10:06,080
She's gonna go straight to Marshall

1073
01:10:06,081 --> 01:10:08,165
and report us, isn't she?

1074
01:10:08,166 --> 01:10:11,670
You need to relax.
Nasha's handling it.

1075
01:10:11,795 --> 01:10:14,881
She can convince anybody of anything.

1076
01:10:14,882 --> 01:10:18,677
Oh, my God. Besides...

1077
01:10:20,345 --> 01:10:23,432
{\an8}this moron is busy with his clown show.

1078
01:10:24,808 --> 01:10:28,060
{\an8}<i>...who wander in the dust and lay them</i>

1079
01:10:28,061 --> 01:10:32,064
{\an8}<i>on this beautiful, manly,
handsome, hunking...</i>

1080
01:10:32,065 --> 01:10:35,943
{\an8}This fucker. Such an attention whore.

1081
01:10:35,944 --> 01:10:41,116
{\an8}<i>...oozing with charisma... rock!</i>

1082
01:10:41,617 --> 01:10:43,910
And what did that asshole
serve for dinner?

1083
01:10:43,911 --> 01:10:45,329
Was it good at least?

1084
01:10:46,205 --> 01:10:49,958
You really wanna know
what went down at that dinner?

1085
01:10:51,168 --> 01:10:55,172
So, the one with 17 on his chest,

1086
01:10:56,006 --> 01:10:58,633
that's the Mickey
that was in my room just before?

1087
01:10:58,634 --> 01:10:59,718
Mm-hmm.

1088
01:11:00,802 --> 01:11:03,930
And the one you were grabbing?

1089
01:11:03,931 --> 01:11:05,556
He's 18, right?

1090
01:11:05,557 --> 01:11:06,475
Yeah.

1091
01:11:08,101 --> 01:11:09,102
Okay.

1092
01:11:13,690 --> 01:11:15,901
You can have 18, and I'll take 17.

1093
01:11:16,944 --> 01:11:17,861
What?

1094
01:11:18,779 --> 01:11:20,655
There's two of them.
Why not share?

1095
01:11:20,656 --> 01:11:23,533
<i>♪ One and only ♪</i>

1096
01:11:23,534 --> 01:11:25,409
So, let me get this straight.

1097
01:11:25,410 --> 01:11:29,372
You were shitting your pants on the floor,

1098
01:11:29,373 --> 01:11:35,420
and he comes up and stabs you
in the neck with a syringe?

1099
01:11:37,631 --> 01:11:39,091
That's what happened?

1100
01:11:39,842 --> 01:11:42,093
I wasn't, like, shitting my pants.

1101
01:11:42,094 --> 01:11:44,888
I was just puking up a little bit.

1102
01:11:45,389 --> 01:11:47,098
That's not the point!

1103
01:11:47,099 --> 01:11:50,184
I've seen you rubbing up on Mickey
every chance you get, you fuckface.

1104
01:11:50,185 --> 01:11:52,937
You know, I've always wanted
to kick the living shit out of you.

1105
01:11:52,938 --> 01:11:55,773
Nasha, come on,
I'm trying to be considerate.

1106
01:11:55,774 --> 01:12:00,278
Mickey 17 was about to double-dip,

1107
01:12:00,279 --> 01:12:02,406
if you know what I mean.

1108
01:12:02,781 --> 01:12:06,242
Move on from you to me.
In fact, we almost--

1109
01:12:06,243 --> 01:12:09,537
- Double-dip? Shut up!
- Oh.

1110
01:12:09,538 --> 01:12:11,540
Mickey is not some cookie
you can split in half.

1111
01:12:11,665 --> 01:12:15,294
17 and 18 are both Mickey.
Both my Mickey.

1112
01:12:15,419 --> 01:12:18,255
So, then after Marshall
fucks you sideways,

1113
01:12:19,047 --> 01:12:21,465
you really let him have it, right?
Right?

1114
01:12:22,885 --> 01:12:23,927
What did you say?

1115
01:12:26,346 --> 01:12:30,183
I just said,
"Thank you for dinner."

1116
01:12:35,230 --> 01:12:36,231
You said what?

1117
01:12:37,065 --> 01:12:39,692
"Thank you for dinner."

1118
01:12:39,693 --> 01:12:41,278
Thank you for fucking what?

1119
01:12:41,987 --> 01:12:44,739
For putting...
...a gun to your head

1120
01:12:44,740 --> 01:12:47,158
before he blows your brains out?

1121
01:12:47,159 --> 01:12:49,744
God, you're such a little bitch!

1122
01:12:49,745 --> 01:12:51,746
Fucking loser!

1123
01:12:54,082 --> 01:12:57,878
I guess-- I guess I am kind of a loser.

1124
01:12:58,003 --> 01:12:59,129
What?

1125
01:13:01,089 --> 01:13:04,259
Is that what you are?

1126
01:13:04,843 --> 01:13:06,928
Huh? Is it?

This guy with the killing.

1134
01:13:40,379 --> 01:13:43,339
"Kill this, kill that.
Why don't we kill everybody?"

1135
01:13:43,340 --> 01:13:45,634
You can stay here

1136

Wait, wait, wait.

1137
01:13:47,845 --> 01:13:51,265
You can't negotiate shit
with that attitude.

1138
01:13:52,474 --> 01:13:53,642
I mean, Jesus.

1139
01:13:55,978 --> 01:13:57,436
You're high on Oxyzofol.

1140
01:13:59,189 --> 01:14:00,232
Mickey?

1141
01:14:01,275 --> 01:14:02,651
Hey, what the--?

1142
01:14:03,569 --> 01:14:05,444
- He-He has your gun.
- Gun?

1143
01:14:05,445 --> 01:14:07,154
We have to stop him.

1144
01:14:07,155 --> 01:14:09,616
What? Where's he going?

1145
01:14:11,368 --> 01:14:14,829
Why? Why, why is Commander Marshall

1146
01:14:14,830 --> 01:14:17,623
cutting into that big,
beautiful, handsome rock?

1147
01:14:25,591 --> 01:14:27,925
Ooh!

1148
01:14:27,926 --> 01:14:30,344
Ooh.

1149
01:14:31,763 --> 01:14:35,683
Beautiful. It's sleek, hot, exquisite.

1150
01:14:35,684 --> 01:14:36,684
Exquisite.

1151
01:14:36,685 --> 01:14:38,936
This is where our names
will be etched.

1152
01:14:38,937 --> 01:14:42,231
Mine and yours. And you!

1153
01:14:42,232 --> 01:14:46,236
And you! And you! And you!

1154
01:14:47,029 --> 01:14:49,406
And you, my beautiful Ylfa.

1155
01:14:50,616 --> 01:14:53,659
Almost every single one of you

1156
01:14:53,660 --> 01:14:56,120
will be remembered
throughout history

1157
01:14:56,121 --> 01:15:01,083
as the proud founders
of Niflheim's first generation.

1158
01:15:01,084 --> 01:15:03,045
Yes!

1159
01:15:03,462 --> 01:15:07,507
Our cornerstone black diamond.

1160
01:15:07,508 --> 01:15:09,926
Beautiful, shimmering purity.

1161
01:15:09,927 --> 01:15:14,305
This rock will become the
symbolic monument of Niflheim,

1162
01:15:14,306 --> 01:15:17,183
the one and only
pure colony planet.

1163
01:15:17,184 --> 01:15:18,392
- The one and only...
- One and only.

1164
01:15:18,393 --> 01:15:19,310
Niflheim!

1165
01:15:19,311 --> 01:15:20,520
The one and only

1166
01:15:20,521 --> 01:15:21,437
Niflheim.

1167
01:15:21,438 --> 01:15:24,483
The one and only!

1168
01:16:08,527 --> 01:16:09,903
No, don't touch it, sir.

1169
01:16:10,946 --> 01:16:11,988
Maybe it's contagious.

1170
01:16:11,989 --> 01:16:13,656
It's contagious!

1171
01:16:14,992 --> 01:16:16,994
You touch it, you die!

- Everyone run!

1173
01:16:20,122 --> 01:16:21,707
- Stop! Stop!
- Mickey!

1174
01:16:22,124 --> 01:16:23,709
- Stop! Go back!
- Mickey!

1175
01:16:24,293 --> 01:16:26,795
Seal the exit!
Isolate the chamber!

1176
01:16:30,716 --> 01:16:32,800
Stay calm, God damn it.

1177
01:16:32,801 --> 01:16:34,178
Sterilization.

1178
01:16:37,723 --> 01:16:40,892
Initiate stage one. Agents!

1179
01:16:40,893 --> 01:16:42,894
Into your hazmat suit!

1180
01:16:42,895 --> 01:16:43,978
- Arkady.
- Yes!

1181
01:16:43,979 --> 01:16:45,606
- Move your ass.
- Okay!

1182
01:16:50,527 --> 01:16:51,861
Capture it!

1183
01:16:51,862 --> 01:16:53,405
Capture it alive!

1184
01:16:57,117 --> 01:16:59,453
It's here! It's here! That's it!

1185
01:16:59,912 --> 01:17:01,245
That's it.

1186
01:17:01,246 --> 01:17:03,581
Get it, get it, get it.

1187
01:17:03,582 --> 01:17:05,626
Get-- Get-- God damn it!

1188
01:17:07,085 --> 01:17:10,922
Hey, Expendable,
you don't need a hazmat suit.

1189
01:17:10,923 --> 01:17:12,799
Catch the goddamn thing!

1190
01:17:27,814 --> 01:17:30,191
Catch that thing now, you idiot!

1191
01:17:30,192 --> 01:17:31,235
Grab it!

1192
01:17:32,027 --> 01:17:32,903
Mickey!

1193
01:17:35,864 --> 01:17:37,157
Where's the other Mickey?

1194
01:17:37,658 --> 01:17:39,575
I don't know!

1195
01:17:39,576 --> 01:17:41,827
Mickey, in here!
In here. Come on!

1196
01:17:41,828 --> 01:17:44,830
Come on, we got it! We got it!

1197
01:17:44,831 --> 01:17:46,999
No, no, no. Take the gun!

1198
01:17:50,379 --> 01:17:51,880
Mickey, no!

1199
01:17:56,760 --> 01:17:58,428
Multiples.

1200
01:17:59,137 --> 01:18:01,514
Don't shoot.
I've got him under control.

1201
01:18:01,515 --> 01:18:02,933
Don't shoot.

1202
01:18:03,725 --> 01:18:06,687
Yes. Calm down. Calm down.

1203
01:18:07,187 --> 01:18:09,397
We have everything under control.

1204
01:18:09,398 --> 01:18:12,317
You rock, Marshall! Bravo!

1205
01:18:13,193 --> 01:18:19,407
Those lowlife Multiples have ruined
our precious symbol of--

1206
01:18:26,164 --> 01:18:27,081
Kill it!

1207
01:18:27,082 --> 01:18:28,916
Get down, sir.

1208
01:18:28,917 --> 01:18:30,294
Open fire!

1209
01:18:38,302 --> 01:18:39,761
Sterilize me!

1210
01:18:56,320 --> 01:18:58,864
Arrest him. Fucking Multiples.

1211
01:19:18,550 --> 01:19:20,259
Tell the Committee
you were aiming at the creeper

1212
01:19:20,260 --> 01:19:21,261
behind Marshall.

1213
01:19:22,012 --> 01:19:23,972
Otherwise, you could get
permanently deleted.

1214
01:19:24,097 --> 01:19:26,934
Fuck that shit.

1215
01:19:28,227 --> 01:19:31,063
You really think Captain Creampie's
gonna let us live?

1216
01:19:33,690 --> 01:19:35,191
He's probably gonna shoot us himself.

1217
01:19:35,192 --> 01:19:37,444
He's a nutjob.

1218
01:19:38,111 --> 01:19:39,738
Doesn't listen to anybody.

1219
01:19:40,489 --> 01:19:43,407
He's the biggest, dumbest nutjob
out of all the Mickeys.

1220
01:19:43,408 --> 01:19:45,118
And that's saying something.

1221
01:19:46,119 --> 01:19:48,746
He screwed my entire life up.

1222
01:19:48,747 --> 01:19:50,039
Oh, really?

1223
01:19:50,040 --> 01:19:52,667
We all got fucked the minute
you decided not to die

1224
01:19:52,668 --> 01:19:55,003
and came crawling home to mummy.

1225
01:19:55,128 --> 01:19:58,090
That wasn't my fault.
That was a creeper's fault.

1226
01:19:59,508 --> 01:20:00,509
Creeper?

1227
01:20:01,134 --> 01:20:04,262
Well, if that creeper's eaten me
like it was supposed to,

1228
01:20:04,263 --> 01:20:06,264
then we wouldn't be in this situation,

1229
01:20:06,265 --> 01:20:08,684
but they all kicked me out

1230
01:20:09,434 --> 01:20:11,103
and now I'm a goddamn Multiple.

1231
01:20:11,728 --> 01:20:12,895
They kicked you out?

1232
01:20:12,896 --> 01:20:13,897
Yeah.

1233
01:20:14,815 --> 01:20:17,400
They were all pushing me
and pulling me,

1234
01:20:17,401 --> 01:20:21,029
and I mean, they all threw me
back into the snow.

1235
01:20:22,489 --> 01:20:26,450
Maybe I don't look tasty enough
or I smell off.

1236
01:20:26,451 --> 01:20:27,870
I don't know.

1237
01:20:29,162 --> 01:20:31,081
Maybe if I was in some kind of sauce.

1238
01:20:31,748 --> 01:20:32,916
Hold on.

1239
01:20:34,626 --> 01:20:36,670
You're telling me they saved you?

1240
01:20:37,796 --> 01:20:39,089
Think about it.

1241
01:20:39,506 --> 01:20:41,883
You should have died
in that crevasse.

1242
01:20:41,884 --> 01:20:43,802
The creepers saved you.

1243
01:20:44,803 --> 01:20:47,097
Uh, yeah, I guess
if you put it like that...

1244
01:20:50,058 --> 01:20:52,019
<i>they were sorta seeing me off.</i>

1245
01:20:53,187 --> 01:20:55,229
Maybe I should have said thank you.

1246
01:20:55,230 --> 01:20:56,440
Yeah.

1247
01:20:57,024 --> 01:20:59,442
I don't think they were gonna eat you.

1248
01:20:59,443 --> 01:21:01,445
Right?

1249
01:21:01,987 --> 01:21:04,155
Oh, my God.

1250
01:21:04,156 --> 01:21:06,908
We have to report this to Science.
They save humans.

1251
01:21:06,909 --> 01:21:09,411
Yeah. People need to know this.

1252
01:21:10,495 --> 01:21:12,206
They saved me.

1253
01:21:22,716 --> 01:21:25,134
Hey. Where's the fucking ladder?

1254
01:21:25,135 --> 01:21:27,136
You were supposed to bring
a fucking ladder.

1255
01:21:27,137 --> 01:21:28,722
I don't know--

1256
01:21:29,640 --> 01:21:31,975
Look, here. Let me help.

1257
01:21:32,518 --> 01:21:35,311
Stop. Stop, stop, stop. Stop.
I'll do it myself.

1258
01:21:35,312 --> 01:21:37,814
I'm coming down myself.
Get the fuck off.

1259
01:21:41,693 --> 01:21:42,527
Come on.

1260
01:21:42,528 --> 01:21:43,654
Hey, Timo.

1261
01:21:44,196 --> 01:21:45,155
What are you doing here?

1262
01:21:45,864 --> 01:21:47,032
Oh, wow.

1263
01:21:47,449 --> 01:21:49,700
You two really are Multiples, huh?

1264
01:21:49,701 --> 01:21:53,538
But it's you. Yeah, I see it
in that schmuck face of yours.

1265
01:21:53,539 --> 01:21:56,374
You're the one who gave me this. Right?

1266
01:21:56,375 --> 01:21:59,127
Oopsie.

1267
01:21:59,503 --> 01:22:02,047
Here you go, guys.
You guys must be starving.

1268
01:22:02,965 --> 01:22:05,092
Thanks, man.
I knew you'd be coming for us.

1269
01:22:07,344 --> 01:22:08,637
What are you up to?

1270
01:22:09,555 --> 01:22:10,806
What's all that?

1271
01:22:11,265 --> 01:22:13,392
So, um,

1272
01:22:14,351 --> 01:22:15,435
here's the thing.

1273
01:22:16,937 --> 01:22:20,440
I need to shoot a video
and send it to Earth, ASAP.

1274
01:22:20,941 --> 01:22:23,276
Video? To Earth?

1275
01:22:23,277 --> 01:22:24,736
Yeah. Um...

1276
01:22:25,112 --> 01:22:26,613
It's for...

1277
01:22:27,614 --> 01:22:28,615
...Darius Blank.

1278
01:22:29,867 --> 01:22:31,451
Darius Blank. Who's that?

1279
01:22:35,372 --> 01:22:37,958
Found this at my door today.

1280
01:22:38,834 --> 01:22:40,961
It's written by hand.

1281
01:22:41,086 --> 01:22:42,963
It's beautiful handwriting.

1282
01:22:45,924 --> 01:22:47,884
This is from Darius Blank's associate?

1283
01:22:47,885 --> 01:22:50,678
Yeah. His associate.

1284
01:22:50,679 --> 01:22:53,515
Fucking, his associate.

1285
01:22:54,391 --> 01:22:56,475
You know what I mean?
Like, of course.

1286
01:22:56,476 --> 01:22:59,854
Of course, the loan shark
of all fucking loan sharks

1287
01:22:59,855 --> 01:23:01,856
would figure out a way
to send one of his guys

1288
01:23:01,857 --> 01:23:03,858
to follow us all the way here,

1289
01:23:03,859 --> 01:23:06,319
to Niflheim, to where we are, right now!

1290
01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:08,404
That's like a million
fucking miles from Ulaanbaatar.

1291
01:23:08,405 --> 01:23:10,823
You know what I'm talking about?
Do you know how far that is?

1292
01:23:10,824 --> 01:23:14,869
"No matter what pittance you managed
to scrape together, we found

1293
01:23:14,870 --> 01:23:19,373
that sending it to Earth will cost you
an intergalactic transfer fee.

1294
01:23:19,374 --> 01:23:22,753
More than... half the total sum."

1295
01:23:22,878 --> 01:23:26,464
The fucking associate!
I have no idea who that is!

1296
01:23:26,465 --> 01:23:30,259
I don't know who that is.
Isn't that fucking crazy?

1297
01:23:30,260 --> 01:23:32,887
"Send a visual work of art.

1298
01:23:32,888 --> 01:23:37,058
A video file that captures
the details of death."

1299
01:23:37,059 --> 01:23:38,393
Read the back.

1300
01:23:39,144 --> 01:23:42,104
It says chop up into
a minimum of 13 pieces.

1301
01:23:42,105 --> 01:23:45,066
Chop up? What the fuck is this?

1302
01:23:45,067 --> 01:23:47,568
Hey! What did I say
about the close-up?

1303
01:23:47,569 --> 01:23:49,237
Close-up is more important, okay?

1304
01:23:49,238 --> 01:23:50,738
So, take the 32K camera,

1305
01:23:50,739 --> 01:23:53,282
and put it over here
for Mr. Darius Blank.

1306
01:23:53,283 --> 01:23:54,493
You understand?

1307
01:23:59,122 --> 01:24:00,541
I'm sorry, Mickey.

1308
01:24:01,416 --> 01:24:05,295
Now, you see, it's all there.
Right? In the letter.

1309
01:24:05,420 --> 01:24:07,213
If I shoot this video,
and I send it to him,

1310
01:24:07,214 --> 01:24:08,798
he'll let me live.

1311
01:24:10,676 --> 01:24:14,136
If I don't, they're gonna
send their guy,

1312
01:24:14,137 --> 01:24:16,306
and he's gonna kill me first.

1313
01:24:17,808 --> 01:24:19,393
What am I supposed to do?

1314
01:24:20,310 --> 01:24:22,980
Come on, dude.
If I die, that's it for me.

1315
01:24:23,814 --> 01:24:24,814
But you're an Expendable.

1316
01:24:24,815 --> 01:24:26,859
They'll just
print you right back out.

1317
01:24:27,860 --> 01:24:32,405
Please, Mickey, I'm your friend.

1318
01:24:32,406 --> 01:24:34,991
Okay, please, do this
for your friend. One time.

1319
01:24:34,992 --> 01:24:37,578
You gotta do this for me, man,
I'm your brother.

1320
01:24:40,789 --> 01:24:46,128
I'm sorry.

1321
01:24:46,253 --> 01:24:48,463
I'm so sorry.

1322
01:24:50,549 --> 01:24:52,008
I'm so sorry.

1323
01:24:52,009 --> 01:24:53,551
Oh, shit.

1324
01:24:53,552 --> 01:24:56,053
Should have killed this guy
when we had the chance.

1325
01:24:56,054 --> 01:24:59,223
You gotta just do this
for me this one time.

1326
01:24:59,224 --> 01:25:01,225
That's all I'm asking.
I'm so sorry.

1327
01:25:01,226 --> 01:25:05,062
Stop crying, you prick!
Getting on my fucking nerves!

1328
01:25:07,357 --> 01:25:09,233
Why don't you guys do
Rock, Paper, Scissors, okay?

1329
01:25:09,234 --> 01:25:11,653
And then we'll just
shoot the loser, yeah?

1330
01:25:11,945 --> 01:25:14,615
No? All right. Shoot him.

1331
01:25:15,407 --> 01:25:16,407
Him?

1332
01:25:16,408 --> 01:25:17,575
Yeah, him.

1333
01:25:17,576 --> 01:25:19,827
I wasn't expecting that.
Thought you'd choose him.

1334
01:25:19,828 --> 01:25:22,413
Yeah, you'd think so, but
the soft one is easier. Come on.

1335
01:25:22,414 --> 01:25:23,207
Okay.

1336
01:25:36,637 --> 01:25:39,348
You're a dumb fucking bitch, Timo.

1337
01:25:41,391 --> 01:25:43,392
If you do this,
and what's-his-face lets you live,

1338
01:25:43,393 --> 01:25:45,436
you think that'll be the end of it?

1339
01:25:45,437 --> 01:25:48,482
You don't think I'll tear you
to fucking pieces myself?

1340
01:25:49,233 --> 01:25:51,442
Oh, my God.
What is the big deal?

1341
01:25:51,443 --> 01:25:53,653
Aw, just take me instead.

1342
01:25:53,654 --> 01:25:54,947
Tie him up.

1343
01:25:56,281 --> 01:25:57,448
What?

1344
01:25:57,449 --> 01:26:00,160
Just chop me up, not him.

1345
01:26:00,744 --> 01:26:01,620
Look at him.

1346
01:26:02,329 --> 01:26:04,580
Shot him one time with
the Taser, it's like he just

1347
01:26:04,581 --> 01:26:07,959
boofed a fucking electric eel, man.

1348
01:26:07,960 --> 01:26:11,505
But you can chop my whole body
up into ten Mickey chunks,

1349
01:26:11,964 --> 01:26:15,300
and I'll still be fresh
as the freshest sashimi.

1350
01:26:16,343 --> 01:26:17,469
Head held high.

1351
01:26:17,970 --> 01:26:19,555
Darius will love that.

1352
01:26:20,973 --> 01:26:22,391
I just need
a little of your help.

1353
01:26:23,016 --> 01:26:23,851
My help?

1354
01:26:24,685 --> 01:26:25,727
Um...

1355
01:26:26,645 --> 01:26:30,566
I kinda need more of that... Oxyzofol.

1356
01:26:33,360 --> 01:26:34,610
Yeah, I got some Oxy.

1357
01:26:34,611 --> 01:26:35,946
But undiluted.

1358
01:26:37,906 --> 01:26:39,323
You want--

1359
01:26:39,324 --> 01:26:41,534
You want undiluted Oxy
right now?

1360
01:26:41,535 --> 01:26:43,787
Yeah.

1361
01:26:44,496 --> 01:26:46,540
Just think of it as the...

1362
01:26:47,416 --> 01:26:49,709
Think of it as the final...

1363
01:26:49,710 --> 01:26:53,380
cigarette before execution.

1364
01:26:55,424 --> 01:26:57,509
It's the least you could do for a friend.

1365
01:26:59,553 --> 01:27:01,596
- Give him yours.
- What?

1366
01:27:01,597 --> 01:27:03,264
- Come on.
- No.

1367
01:27:03,265 --> 01:27:05,559
I'll give you a freebie next time.
You know me.

1368
01:27:07,769 --> 01:27:09,313
This was expensive.

1369
01:27:15,652 --> 01:27:16,320
The keys.

1370
01:27:27,748 --> 01:27:28,832
Nasha.

1371
01:27:29,333 --> 01:27:30,334
Don't.

1372
01:27:31,710 --> 01:27:32,878
Do it.

1373
01:27:37,591 --> 01:27:39,593
Nasha, what are you doing?

1374
01:27:41,261 --> 01:27:42,720
What's going on here?

1375
01:27:42,721 --> 01:27:45,389
Nasha. Stay put.

1376
01:27:48,310 --> 01:27:50,394
<i>That did kind of shock me a bit.</i>

1377
01:27:50,395 --> 01:27:53,022
<i>I mean, she literally was gonna
cut his head off</i>

1378
01:27:53,023 --> 01:27:54,441
<i>with a chain saw.</i>

1379
01:27:55,192 --> 01:28:00,614
<i>Uh, but then, I thought about
it, and I was so... touched.</i>

1380
01:28:03,617 --> 01:28:07,246
<i>She's the only person who'd
ever lose it like that over me.</i>

1381
01:28:08,789 --> 01:28:10,707
<i>And it wasn't the first time either.</i>

1382
01:28:12,876 --> 01:28:15,337
Hello? Can we help you?

1383
01:28:15,462 --> 01:28:17,005
Nasha, just go.

1384
01:28:17,923 --> 01:28:19,131
- Take it off.
- Hey, hey, hey.

1385
01:28:19,132 --> 01:28:20,216
- I need to go in there.
- What are you doing?

1386
01:28:20,217 --> 01:28:21,467
Take it off.
I am going in there.

1387
01:28:21,468 --> 01:28:22,510
You've left him in there alone.

1388
01:28:22,511 --> 01:28:23,970
But that's his job.

1389
01:28:23,971 --> 01:28:25,555
I don't care if it's his job.

1390
01:28:25,556 --> 01:28:27,515
Okay, look,
I'm gonna call security.

1391
01:28:27,516 --> 01:28:28,517
I don't know what else--

1392
01:28:28,642 --> 01:28:31,520
I am security! Give me the suit!

1393
01:28:33,981 --> 01:28:35,606
Threes, threes, threes.

1394
01:28:35,607 --> 01:28:37,192
- Arkady 3.0.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1395
01:28:49,288 --> 01:28:50,455
You're okay.

1396
01:28:58,630 --> 01:28:59,882
Shh.

1397
01:29:04,678 --> 01:29:06,971
<i>Nasha, she's the only one</i>

1398
01:29:06,972 --> 01:29:09,016
<i>who's always been there for me.</i>

1399
01:29:09,933 --> 01:29:11,768
<i>She's always loved me.</i>

1400
01:29:12,686 --> 01:29:13,770
<i>Every me.</i>

1401
01:29:14,813 --> 01:29:16,273
<i>Even him.</i>

1402
01:29:17,107 --> 01:29:19,193
<i>The me I don't understand at all.</i>

1403
01:29:20,194 --> 01:29:21,027
What is this?

1404
01:29:21,028 --> 01:29:22,445
Oh, you don't know about this.

1405
01:29:22,446 --> 01:29:24,197
They've been circling
the whole night.

1406
01:29:24,198 --> 01:29:25,364
And still more coming in.

1407
01:29:25,365 --> 01:29:26,782
What are they doing?

1408
01:29:26,783 --> 01:29:29,785
We don't know. They can break
through solid ice and stone.

1409
01:29:29,786 --> 01:29:32,288
Imagine if they all come for this ship.
Terrifying.

1410
01:29:32,289 --> 01:29:33,873
But it couldn't even
tear through the sack

1411
01:29:33,874 --> 01:29:34,999
at the cafeteria.

1412
01:29:36,335 --> 01:29:39,087
You hear that? It's coming from
the one we captured yesterday.

1413
01:29:39,213 --> 01:29:40,254
Keep going, keep going.

1414
01:29:40,255 --> 01:29:41,839
Wait, what-- You mean, the baby?

1415
01:29:41,840 --> 01:29:44,593
Well, yeah, it's been screaming
and crying like one.

1416
01:29:44,718 --> 01:29:46,929
And that's when
they all started gathering.

1417
01:29:49,473 --> 01:29:50,140
Wait.

1418
01:29:51,308 --> 01:29:52,975
- Hey.
- Mickey, don't stop.

1419
01:29:52,976 --> 01:29:55,144
That was--
That was the one that I...

1420
01:29:55,145 --> 01:29:56,187
Keep moving.

1421
01:29:56,188 --> 01:29:57,272
Never mind.

1422
01:29:58,357 --> 01:30:00,733
Hi! How ya doing?

1423
01:30:00,734 --> 01:30:01,818
Excuse me.

1424
01:30:02,402 --> 01:30:03,487
Come on.

1425
01:30:03,820 --> 01:30:05,613
Sorry, passing through.

1426
01:30:05,614 --> 01:30:08,366
Hey. Why did they set up
the Situation Room there?

1427
01:30:08,367 --> 01:30:10,159
Beats me. I was just told
to bring the prisoner.

1428
01:30:10,160 --> 01:30:11,744
Apparently,
Ylfa made a big scene.

1429
01:30:11,745 --> 01:30:13,621
She wants the creeper now.

1430
01:30:13,622 --> 01:30:15,122
Dorothy,
I have crucial information

1431
01:30:15,123 --> 01:30:16,207
about the creepers.

1432
01:30:16,208 --> 01:30:18,418
Mickey needs to file an official
report with the head of Science.

1433
01:30:18,544 --> 01:30:20,420
Oh, wait.

1434
01:30:29,930 --> 01:30:31,306
Yes. I knew it.

1435
01:30:31,640 --> 01:30:33,432
Yesterday, at the cafeteria,

1436
01:30:33,433 --> 01:30:35,810
when you held onto the baby,
I saw it.

1437
01:30:35,811 --> 01:30:37,312
You saw that?

1438
01:30:38,272 --> 01:30:39,605
I don't know what it means, though.

1439
01:30:39,606 --> 01:30:41,607
Oh. So, you're just imitating.

1440
01:30:41,608 --> 01:30:42,733
Well, originally, I--

1441
01:30:42,734 --> 01:30:44,235
Dorothy, look alive!

1442
01:30:44,236 --> 01:30:47,154
It's really hectic right now.
Let's talk later.

1443
01:30:47,155 --> 01:30:48,240
We're recording their sounds

1444
01:30:48,365 --> 01:30:50,534
to see if we can analyze
any kind of pattern.

1445
01:30:51,451 --> 01:30:53,995
<i>The Committee is declaring
a level three emergency.</i>

1446
01:30:53,996 --> 01:30:55,955
<i>Sole commanding control
has been granted</i>

1447
01:30:55,956 --> 01:30:57,832
<i>to Commander Marshall
by a vote of...</i>

1448
01:30:57,833 --> 01:30:58,959
<i>...36 to 21.</i>

1449
01:31:02,254 --> 01:31:03,589
- Thank you.
- Oh.

1450
01:31:04,965 --> 01:31:08,050
What an event. This is
a truly novel ingredient.

1451
01:31:09,303 --> 01:31:12,096
This opens up a whole new world
of potential sauces.

1452
01:31:12,097 --> 01:31:15,516
Mm. It's such a great...
How should I put it?

1453
01:31:15,517 --> 01:31:19,812
Opportunity, ma'am.
Yes, quite the opportunity. Just super.

1454
01:31:19,813 --> 01:31:22,440
Yes, it is a super opportunity.

1455
01:31:28,071 --> 01:31:30,115
Oh, wow.

1456
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:33,285
It's such a godsend, too.

1457
01:31:34,828 --> 01:31:36,954
It is free from
harmful pathogens, correct?

1458
01:31:36,955 --> 01:31:38,581
Yes, ma'am, sure.

1459
01:31:59,019 --> 01:32:01,063
Which dickhead is it? Mickey 18?

1460
01:32:02,356 --> 01:32:03,857
Keep his head still.

1461
01:32:08,403 --> 01:32:11,365
Now, I can tell you two apart.
Filthy Multiples.

1462
01:32:11,490 --> 01:32:14,033
Oh, yeah. That does seem fair.

1463
01:32:14,034 --> 01:32:15,910
Oh, goodness. Burnt meat.

1464
01:32:15,911 --> 01:32:17,578
Well, that's nothing, honey.

1465
01:32:17,579 --> 01:32:20,540
Wait until these two are
scorched sausages in the cycler.

1466
01:32:20,541 --> 01:32:22,083
How are you gonna handle
that stench?

1467
01:32:22,084 --> 01:32:23,168
I'm going as fast as I can.

1468
01:32:24,503 --> 01:32:27,464
Mickey. I'm so sorry.

1469
01:32:28,173 --> 01:32:30,967
You two. This brick
stores your memories, right?

1470
01:32:30,968 --> 01:32:31,926
Now, you'll watch

1471
01:32:31,927 --> 01:32:34,471
as I permanently
delete your being from it.

1472
01:32:34,930 --> 01:32:38,599
That way you'll understand the
meaning and terror of finality.

1473
01:32:38,600 --> 01:32:40,268
No more reprints!

1474
01:32:40,269 --> 01:32:42,770
That's what you both
should be thinking when you die.

1475
01:32:42,771 --> 01:32:44,106
Dead forever!

1476
01:32:45,232 --> 01:32:48,067
Now that the memory is gone,
which body goes first?

1477
01:32:48,068 --> 01:32:50,153
One at a time is twice the fun.

1478
01:32:50,612 --> 01:32:51,362
Creepy.

1479
01:32:51,363 --> 01:32:52,948
Commander Marshall, sir.

1480
01:32:53,824 --> 01:32:55,033
May I say a few words?

1481
01:32:55,492 --> 01:32:57,911
Regardless of who burns first,
a simple fact is,

1482
01:32:58,328 --> 01:33:00,580
we currently have
two Mickeys here before us.

1483
01:33:00,581 --> 01:33:02,915
Due to no fault on their part,
I might add.

1484
01:33:02,916 --> 01:33:04,458
One of them
is being falsely accused

1485
01:33:04,459 --> 01:33:05,627
of firing his gun at you.

1486
01:33:05,752 --> 01:33:09,423
But the truth is, he was
concerned for your safety.

1487
01:33:10,924 --> 01:33:12,341
He was the first
to notice the second creeper

1488
01:33:12,342 --> 01:33:13,509
coming out of the stone
behind you,

1489
01:33:13,510 --> 01:33:15,261
and as you are well aware

1490
01:33:15,262 --> 01:33:16,429
the day an Expendable is printed--

1491
01:33:16,430 --> 01:33:17,347
Enough.

1492
01:33:17,681 --> 01:33:19,765
You defending these idiots.

1493
01:33:19,766 --> 01:33:21,726
Should be mopping up your own shit.

1494
01:33:21,727 --> 01:33:24,145
Illegal possession of Oxyzofol.

1495
01:33:24,146 --> 01:33:25,855
Concealment of a Multiples violation.

1496
01:33:25,856 --> 01:33:26,981
It's disappointing.

1497
01:33:26,982 --> 01:33:28,733
And attempted murder
with a fucking chain saw?

1498
01:33:29,735 --> 01:33:31,277
I mean, it's quite
the colorful rap sheet,

1499
01:33:31,278 --> 01:33:32,446
don't you think, Miss. Barridge?

1500
01:33:32,571 --> 01:33:34,864
Mmm.
The clouds of war are billowing.

1501
01:33:34,865 --> 01:33:37,074
Look at those vermin swarm.

1502
01:33:37,075 --> 01:33:39,368
Mankind must unite
at this critical juncture.

1503
01:33:39,369 --> 01:33:42,788
Why are we wasting our time
with these dregs of society?

1504
01:33:42,789 --> 01:33:47,044
Spoken like a true wartime commander, sir.
Very impressive.

1505
01:33:47,169 --> 01:33:48,753
And a fine entry

1506
01:33:48,754 --> 01:33:50,755
to add to your collection
of battle quotes, if I may.

1507
01:33:50,756 --> 01:33:52,006
- You like that?
- I do.

1508
01:33:52,007 --> 01:33:53,257
- More of that?
- Please.

1509
01:33:53,258 --> 01:33:55,636
You keep mentioning that
we're in a state of war.

1510
01:33:56,929 --> 01:33:59,472
May I be so bold as to
offer two observations, sir?

1511
01:33:59,473 --> 01:34:01,474
Be my guest.

1512
01:34:01,475 --> 01:34:04,143
Firstly, fighting a war requires
a huge amount

1513
01:34:04,144 --> 01:34:05,854
of energy and calories.

1514
01:34:06,647 --> 01:34:08,648
Seeing as we're in
the early stages of settlement,

1515
01:34:08,649 --> 01:34:10,650
and our survival is in the balance,

1516
01:34:10,651 --> 01:34:13,110
I wonder whether
this expenditure is prudent.

1517
01:34:13,111 --> 01:34:16,405
Secondly, our apparent enemies
are the creepers.

1518
01:34:16,406 --> 01:34:20,243
But do we know whether they
actually want to engage in war?

1519
01:34:20,244 --> 01:34:23,204
For hours they've been swirling in circles
doing nothing but waiting.

1520
01:34:23,205 --> 01:34:26,123
My God, Agent Barridge.

1521
01:34:26,124 --> 01:34:31,255
You used to be a five time
Marshall Cup champion.

1522
01:34:31,380 --> 01:34:33,756
"Agent of the Month."

1523
01:34:33,757 --> 01:34:38,261
And now, you're sweating
over these alien insects?

1524
01:34:38,262 --> 01:34:41,265
How far you've fallen.

1525
01:34:41,890 --> 01:34:42,932
What are you gonna do

1526
01:34:42,933 --> 01:34:46,270
when they tear a hole in the ship
and tear off your ass?

1527
01:34:47,729 --> 01:34:49,146
These grotesque shit-gibbons.

1528
01:34:49,147 --> 01:34:50,273
Grotesque or not,

1529
01:34:50,274 --> 01:34:52,775
they are the native inhabitants
of this planet.

1530
01:34:52,776 --> 01:34:55,403
And we have proof
that they saved one of us.

1531
01:34:55,404 --> 01:34:57,613
They didn't eat him or attack him.

1532
01:34:57,614 --> 01:34:59,240
Saved and not eaten whom?

1533
01:34:59,241 --> 01:35:01,952
Uh, me.

1534
01:35:03,203 --> 01:35:04,746
They saved me.

1535
01:35:10,043 --> 01:35:13,129
Of course they didn't eat you.
You're crap food.

1536
01:35:13,130 --> 01:35:15,631
You're recycled Spam baby.

1537
01:35:15,632 --> 01:35:19,343
You get chewed up and shit out
over and over and over again.

1538
01:35:19,344 --> 01:35:21,596
Well, I guess they aren't
just stupid bugs, honey.

1539
01:35:21,597 --> 01:35:23,932
I mean,
they knew to pass on crap, junk.

1540
01:35:24,057 --> 01:35:26,058
They must have
some cognitive ability.

1541
01:35:26,059 --> 01:35:27,394
Exactly.

1542
01:35:28,061 --> 01:35:30,730
Actually, they exhibit signs
of high intelligence.

1543
01:35:30,731 --> 01:35:33,524
They may be able to engage
in meaningful conversation.

1544
01:35:33,525 --> 01:35:35,986
And we're analyzing this, and...

1545
01:35:37,029 --> 01:35:41,616
Sir, you must try communicating
with them yourself.

1546
01:35:41,617 --> 01:35:44,869
We're developing
a-a, um, a sort of translator.

1547
01:35:46,788 --> 01:35:50,292
Like that, you mean?
You think I'm an idiot?

1548
01:35:50,876 --> 01:35:53,712
Uh.

1549
01:36:08,852 --> 01:36:12,480
Four and a half years
across the fucking galaxy,

1550
01:36:12,481 --> 01:36:16,567
just to hear
these goddamn aliens squawk?

1551
01:36:16,568 --> 01:36:20,196
Tell me how the fuck
that makes any sense! Somebody!

1552
01:36:20,197 --> 01:36:21,740
How does this make any sense?

1553
01:36:22,574 --> 01:36:24,492
How does your bullshit
make any sense?

1554
01:36:24,493 --> 01:36:26,077
Your fucking fuckface

1555
01:36:26,078 --> 01:36:27,828
is what really
doesn't make any fucking sense

1556
01:36:27,829 --> 01:36:29,665
you fucking idiot!

1557
01:36:30,791 --> 01:36:33,752
You call them aliens.
We're the aliens, dumbass.

1558
01:36:33,877 --> 01:36:36,296
They were living here before us,
and Mickey...

1559
01:36:37,297 --> 01:36:39,174
Mickey was always
just Mickey Barnes.

1560
01:36:40,133 --> 01:36:41,843
Do you even understand
what that means?

1561
01:36:41,844 --> 01:36:43,845
They were just living their lives.

1562
01:36:43,846 --> 01:36:47,223
Before you came in with your bullshit!

1563
01:36:47,224 --> 01:36:49,600
And you think you get to decide
who lives and who dies.

1564
01:36:49,601 --> 01:36:52,521
You are a dumb fuck!

1565
01:36:54,189 --> 01:36:55,523
No wonder you blew the elections,

1566
01:36:55,524 --> 01:36:57,401
you fucking moron.

1567
01:37:12,666 --> 01:37:15,711
No! No, no. No, stop!

1568
01:37:15,836 --> 01:37:19,590
What the fuck is wrong with you?
You're hurting a baby!

1569
01:37:28,932 --> 01:37:29,933
Bite.

1570
01:37:30,893 --> 01:37:32,060
What?

1571
01:37:32,561 --> 01:37:35,105
Falling in three, two, one.

1572
01:37:42,446 --> 01:37:44,864
Finally, she shut the fuck up.

1573
01:37:47,993 --> 01:37:51,121
This is clearly abuse,
one case after the other.

1574
01:37:52,664 --> 01:37:53,665
Rolling.

1575
01:37:56,251 --> 01:37:58,170
In 32K.

1576
01:37:59,755 --> 01:38:01,130
Make sure you get everything.

1577
01:38:01,131 --> 01:38:03,008
- Impressive teeth.
- Yeah.

1578
01:38:03,634 --> 01:38:05,718
We need more of our guys.

1579
01:38:05,719 --> 01:38:10,598
Sir, now might be the prime time
to initiate Total Extermination.

1580
01:38:10,599 --> 01:38:13,100
The ones out there alone
would be more than enough.

1581
01:38:13,101 --> 01:38:14,602
What are you talking about?

1582
01:38:14,603 --> 01:38:16,729
We're gonna gas 'em,
we're gonna gas 'em all.

1583
01:38:19,233 --> 01:38:22,485
What's that look for? Still not
confident in your failures?

1584
01:38:22,486 --> 01:38:25,363
No. No. Sir, Arkady 3.0

1585
01:38:25,364 --> 01:38:27,615
has gone through several
meticulous stages of testing.

1586
01:38:27,616 --> 01:38:30,785
Arkady 3.0 is the ultimate nerve gas.

1587
01:38:30,786 --> 01:38:32,620
I have every confidence in it, sir.

1588
01:38:32,621 --> 01:38:35,248
As you should, Arkady.
This has to succeed.

1589
01:38:35,249 --> 01:38:37,000
I'll put it in my prayers.

1590
01:38:37,751 --> 01:38:40,128
This is the day
we've been waiting for, sir.

1591
01:38:40,254 --> 01:38:42,922
Future historians
will mark today as era-defining

1592
01:38:42,923 --> 01:38:45,342
for cleansing dangerous species
on colony planets.

1593
01:38:45,801 --> 01:38:48,386
Why don't you board
the flitter yourself later?

1594
01:38:48,387 --> 01:38:50,430
- You mean when we spray the gas?
- Yeah.

1595
01:38:51,431 --> 01:38:53,599
- I pull the trigger?
- Exactly, sir.

1596
01:38:53,600 --> 01:38:55,309
If you ride the lead flitter

1597
01:38:55,310 --> 01:38:58,312
and appear
to commandeer the operation,

1598
01:38:58,313 --> 01:39:01,357
the footage I get, it will be historic.

1599
01:39:01,358 --> 01:39:03,734
And the members, the church
members back on Earth...

1600
01:39:03,735 --> 01:39:05,320
- Huh?
- They will adore.

1601
01:39:05,779 --> 01:39:07,613
Yes, yes, the company.

1602
01:39:07,614 --> 01:39:11,325
All right. It's time we initiate
Operation Total Extermination.

1603
01:39:11,326 --> 01:39:12,577
Honey, can I have a word with you?

1604
01:39:12,578 --> 01:39:13,787
Yes, my love.

1605
01:39:14,872 --> 01:39:15,873
I've got an idea.

1606
01:39:19,334 --> 01:39:21,920
I hope you both can appreciate
what a great honor my wife

1607
01:39:22,045 --> 01:39:24,255
is bestowing on you shit stains.

1608
01:39:24,256 --> 01:39:27,633
And so I can press
both buttons simultaneously?

1609
01:39:27,634 --> 01:39:30,052
Yes, sir. Press them,
and they'll go off at the same time.

1610
01:39:30,053 --> 01:39:31,596
They'll also explode automatically

1611
01:39:31,597 --> 01:39:33,307
if they exit the range
of the remote control.

1612
01:39:33,640 --> 01:39:35,224
You hear that?
I have you by the balls,

1613
01:39:35,225 --> 01:39:36,601
so don't even think of running off.

1614
01:39:36,602 --> 01:39:38,686
You'll each be given a primitive
weapon as you head out.

1615
01:39:38,687 --> 01:39:40,771
You cut off as many
creeper tails as you can

1616
01:39:40,772 --> 01:39:44,275
and the first Mickey to bring
back 100 tails is the winner.

1617
01:39:44,276 --> 01:39:47,320
And the winner doesn't die,
but the loser goes...

1618
01:39:48,822 --> 01:39:49,739
- Boom!
- Boom!

1619
01:39:49,740 --> 01:39:50,490
Boom.

1620
01:39:51,241 --> 01:39:53,075
We'll keep score from here.

1621
01:39:53,076 --> 01:39:55,912
Your job is to make them
scream so loudly

1622
01:39:55,913 --> 01:39:59,081
that every last creeper
comes running in to save them.

1623
01:39:59,082 --> 01:40:01,210
We'll kill two birds
with one stone, right honey?

1624
01:40:01,335 --> 01:40:03,212
Absolutely.
A hundred tails is enough

1625
01:40:03,337 --> 01:40:05,087
to make enough sauce
to last a couple years.

1626
01:40:05,088 --> 01:40:07,173
Better be on your toes.

1627
01:40:07,174 --> 01:40:10,010
One false move,
and you're man-burger.

1628
01:40:22,606 --> 01:40:24,274
I get it.

1629
01:40:25,526 --> 01:40:27,194
It's all punishment.

1630
01:40:29,029 --> 01:40:30,030
What was that?

1631
01:40:32,157 --> 01:40:35,868
Our entire life's
a goddamn punishment.

1632
01:40:35,869 --> 01:40:38,580
All for pressing that button
when I was five.

1633
01:40:39,790 --> 01:40:43,669
Oh. This again!

1634
01:40:43,794 --> 01:40:46,755
Accident was caused
by a car defect, you know that.

1635
01:40:47,714 --> 01:40:49,132
I don't know.

1636
01:40:53,720 --> 01:40:56,056
Well, it wasn't pressing
that stupid button.

1637
01:40:57,933 --> 01:41:01,018
It wasn't Mom's driving either.

1638
01:41:01,019 --> 01:41:02,938
How many times I gotta tell you?

1639
01:41:06,733 --> 01:41:11,028
Sorry, Mickey-- Mickeys.
You need to move, like now.

1640
01:41:11,029 --> 01:41:12,572
Can you at least
put the ramp down?

1641
01:41:12,573 --> 01:41:14,490
We can't do that right now.
I'm sorry.

1642
01:41:14,491 --> 01:41:16,201
- You're gonna have to jump.
- Whoa!

1643
01:41:18,704 --> 01:41:20,038
Mickey!

1644
01:41:20,497 --> 01:41:21,498
Mickey!

1645
01:41:22,291 --> 01:41:24,459
Wait, Mickey.

1646
01:41:26,253 --> 01:41:27,212
Take this.

1647
01:41:28,505 --> 01:41:29,839
It's not finished,
but it might help you

1648
01:41:29,840 --> 01:41:31,300
- communicate with the creepers.
- Let's go!

1649
01:41:31,884 --> 01:41:33,634
It's like a--
It's like a translator thing?

1650
01:41:33,635 --> 01:41:34,803
Yes. Good luck.

1651
01:41:35,345 --> 01:41:37,471
For what it's worth, I doubt
Marshall will kill both of you.

1652
01:41:37,472 --> 01:41:38,348
Come on.

1653
01:41:39,349 --> 01:41:40,017
Come.

1654
01:41:40,642 --> 01:41:43,645
- Let's go.
- Well, I...

1655
01:41:47,608 --> 01:41:54,031
Uh, anyway, with this device,
I got a job to do.

1656
01:41:55,532 --> 01:41:59,536
All right. They saved me,
now I save them.

1657
01:42:00,162 --> 01:42:02,246
What are those fuckers doing?

1658
01:42:02,247 --> 01:42:05,416
Even I can count dozens of fresh
tails they're leaving behind.

1659
01:42:05,417 --> 01:42:07,044
Are they out of their minds?

1660
01:42:07,794 --> 01:42:09,545
Oh, honey.

1661
01:42:09,546 --> 01:42:12,674
- Should I just press the button?
- Mmm.

1662
01:42:13,217 --> 01:42:15,552
Let's sit back and watch.

1663
01:42:16,720 --> 01:42:18,679
They'll start chopping tails
as soon as they realize

1664
01:42:18,680 --> 01:42:21,432
one of them
has to outlive the other.

1665
01:42:22,809 --> 01:42:23,894
Hey!

1666
01:42:25,187 --> 01:42:27,147
It's me! Wait!

1667
01:42:28,649 --> 01:42:32,110
You gotta run away.
You gotta get them all outta here.

1668
01:42:32,778 --> 01:42:34,363
You gotta go back to your cave.

1669
01:42:35,072 --> 01:42:38,241
Go back to your cave.

1670
01:42:41,620 --> 01:42:43,454
Or you're all gonna die.

1671
01:42:45,541 --> 01:42:46,542
<i>What?</i>

1672
01:42:47,209 --> 01:42:47,960
Oh, hello.

1673
01:42:49,878 --> 01:42:50,963
Um...

1674
01:42:51,797 --> 01:42:55,342
Yes, I just, I wanted...
About last time, I...

1675
01:42:58,136 --> 01:43:01,055
I wanted to say thank you.

1676
01:43:01,056 --> 01:43:02,516
Um...

1677
01:43:03,809 --> 01:43:05,644
You remember me, right?

1678
01:43:07,604 --> 01:43:08,939
<i>Mickey.</i>

1679
01:43:11,775 --> 01:43:13,569
How do you know my name?

1680
01:43:16,530 --> 01:43:17,990
<i>Secret.</i>

1681
01:43:19,032 --> 01:43:21,243
Wait, are they
having a conversation?

1682
01:43:22,578 --> 01:43:25,580
Yes. We already explained it just now.

1683
01:43:25,581 --> 01:43:27,290
How is this possible?

1684
01:43:27,291 --> 01:43:29,960
Well, it's still a prototype,

1685
01:43:30,085 --> 01:43:33,129
but it's like a translator device.

1686
01:43:33,130 --> 01:43:36,257
Dorothy? Oh, no.
Where's Dorothy?

1687
01:43:36,258 --> 01:43:38,926
I can't hear a thing with all this static.

1688
01:43:38,927 --> 01:43:40,929
I mean, even the video is shit.

1689
01:43:41,597 --> 01:43:44,849
Apologies, sir. The snowstorm
is exacerbating the absorption--

1690
01:43:44,850 --> 01:43:47,476
What about this?
Will this detonator work?

1691
01:43:47,477 --> 01:43:49,645
Yes, sir. That is a special
shortwave signal,

1692
01:43:49,646 --> 01:43:50,563
so it'll be fine.

1693
01:43:50,564 --> 01:43:53,024
And who's that big one there?

1694
01:43:53,025 --> 01:43:54,233
Is that the queen bee of the bunch?

1695
01:43:54,234 --> 01:43:57,028
Mmm. Looks like a croissant
dipped in shit.

1696
01:43:57,029 --> 01:44:01,115
Uh, official reports
are still being finalized,

1697
01:44:01,116 --> 01:44:04,160
but we think everything revolves
around that one,

1698
01:44:04,161 --> 01:44:05,829
the Mama Creeper.

1699
01:44:05,954 --> 01:44:08,290
So, that one's the boss.
Like you.

1700
01:44:10,375 --> 01:44:11,919
<i>Say what?</i>

1701
01:44:12,044 --> 01:44:14,212
You gotta get outta here,

1702
01:44:14,213 --> 01:44:16,882
or they're gonna kill you
all with this death gas.

1703
01:44:18,091 --> 01:44:22,553
That gas, Arkady 3.0,
I got blasted with that.

1704
01:44:22,554 --> 01:44:25,724
It's seriously, insanely painful.

1705
01:44:27,684 --> 01:44:31,188
Do you know what gas is?
Gas. Like...

1706
01:44:32,189 --> 01:44:34,525
Like gas?

1707
01:44:37,819 --> 01:44:40,530
<i>Mind your own business, stupid.</i>

1708
01:44:40,531 --> 01:44:44,034
Mind my own business?
What about you?

1709
01:44:45,035 --> 01:44:47,079
Why'd you save him at the cave?

1710
01:44:49,915 --> 01:44:51,750
<i>Should kill him?</i>

1711
01:44:52,167 --> 01:44:54,086
No. No.

1712
01:44:55,170 --> 01:44:58,674
I'm-- We're very grateful.
That's all.

1713
01:44:59,424 --> 01:45:00,676
<i>Then why?</i>

1714
01:45:03,554 --> 01:45:05,055
<i>Why kill Luco?</i>

1715
01:45:06,139 --> 01:45:08,684
Uh, Luco?

1716
01:45:10,936 --> 01:45:13,272
<i>Baby Luco.</i>

1717
01:45:14,648 --> 01:45:15,649
Oh.

1718
01:45:17,818 --> 01:45:21,613
<i>You group. Shattered.</i>

1719
01:45:22,698 --> 01:45:23,739
<i>Blood.</i>

1720
01:45:23,740 --> 01:45:24,992
Yeah...

1721
01:45:25,534 --> 01:45:26,577
Oh, that's...

1722
01:45:27,578 --> 01:45:28,579
That's Luco.

1723
01:45:30,706 --> 01:45:32,499
<i>We save you.</i>

1724
01:45:35,085 --> 01:45:38,463
<i>You kill Luco.</i>

1725
01:45:43,093 --> 01:45:45,971
So, what's the name of the other baby?
The one in the ship.

1726
01:45:46,847 --> 01:45:49,266
<i>Zoco.</i>

1727
01:45:50,350 --> 01:45:53,604
<i>Kill Zoco too?</i>

1728
01:45:54,104 --> 01:45:58,275
What if Zoco dies?
What will you do?

1729
01:46:00,694 --> 01:46:02,029
<i>Death.</i>

1730
01:46:02,696 --> 01:46:04,072
<i>All.</i>

1731
01:46:07,618 --> 01:46:09,369
You mean all humans.

1732
01:46:13,457 --> 01:46:15,959
<i>- Extinction.</i>
- How?

1733
01:46:17,294 --> 01:46:19,880
<i>Easy.</i>

1734
01:47:01,588 --> 01:47:05,550
<i>Cover your ear.</i>

1735
01:47:05,551 --> 01:47:08,595
<i>But eyeball explode.</i>

1736
01:47:11,640 --> 01:47:13,517
<i>Brain explode.</i>

1737
01:47:16,103 --> 01:47:17,562
<i>All of you.</i>

1738
01:47:24,695 --> 01:47:25,904
Nasha!

1739
01:47:26,655 --> 01:47:27,656
Nasha!

1740
01:47:34,371 --> 01:47:35,581
Nasha!

1741
01:47:36,039 --> 01:47:38,292
Nasha! Look at me!

1742
01:47:39,668 --> 01:47:40,919
Look at my mouth.

1743
01:47:43,589 --> 01:47:46,215
What's wrong with them?
What's wrong with him?

1744
01:47:46,216 --> 01:47:49,302
And they're saying something.
What is that idiot saying?

1745
01:47:49,303 --> 01:47:51,555
It's not sign language.

1746
01:47:51,972 --> 01:47:53,515
C3!

1747
01:47:54,057 --> 01:47:55,475
C3!

1748
01:47:59,688 --> 01:48:02,023
C... 3?

1749
01:48:02,024 --> 01:48:03,357
3?

1750
01:48:03,358 --> 01:48:05,694
C3? What's C3?

1751
01:48:05,819 --> 01:48:06,819
C3?

1752
01:48:15,120 --> 01:48:15,912
Bring the baby.

1753
01:48:15,913 --> 01:48:17,414
<i>Bring the baby.</i>

1754
01:48:17,831 --> 01:48:20,166
Bring the baby.

1755
01:48:20,167 --> 01:48:21,960
<i>If we don't bring her back,</i>

1756
01:48:22,669 --> 01:48:24,420
<i>we're all gonna die.</i>

1757
01:48:24,421 --> 01:48:26,047
Honey, this doesn't sit well with me.

1758
01:48:26,048 --> 01:48:27,840
Why are those two losers chatting

1759
01:48:27,841 --> 01:48:28,966
with the boss of the bugs?

1760
01:48:28,967 --> 01:48:30,301
They think they're negotiating

1761
01:48:30,302 --> 01:48:32,053
on behalf of mankind--
humankind?

1762
01:48:32,054 --> 01:48:34,388
You should be standing out there, sir,

1763
01:48:34,389 --> 01:48:36,850
ushering in this historic moment.

1764
01:48:37,684 --> 01:48:40,353
You're seeing two bosses meeting

1765
01:48:40,354 --> 01:48:43,022
face to face
in a climactic snowstorm?

1766
01:48:43,023 --> 01:48:44,273
A moment of destiny?

1767
01:48:44,274 --> 01:48:46,317
All you have to do
is go out there.

1768
01:48:46,318 --> 01:48:48,236
I know I can create an iconic scene.

1769
01:48:48,237 --> 01:48:51,614
A decisive moment in the history
of the Niflheim settlement.

1770
01:48:51,615 --> 01:48:53,742
- Bring the baby.
- I can picture it now.

1771
01:48:53,867 --> 01:48:57,036
Adorning the ceiling and
the walls of the grand chapel.

1772
01:48:57,037 --> 01:48:58,914
Yes, ma'am, yes.

1773
01:48:59,623 --> 01:49:01,958
And one final touch, sir.

1774
01:49:01,959 --> 01:49:04,169
I think it would be great
if you give them a message

1775
01:49:04,294 --> 01:49:05,837
before spraying the gas.

1776
01:49:05,838 --> 01:49:06,922
A message?

1777
01:49:07,339 --> 01:49:10,341
Without such poignancy, today
would be a third-rate carnival

1778
01:49:10,342 --> 01:49:13,761
where we spray cheap pesticide
over cockroaches.

1779
01:49:13,762 --> 01:49:17,640
Yes, they are disgusting,
filthy, evil insects,

1780
01:49:17,641 --> 01:49:19,517
but it will be their last moment,

1781
01:49:19,518 --> 01:49:22,103
and you could offer them
a few merciful words

1782
01:49:22,104 --> 01:49:26,733
as a proper farewell,
like a wise, benevolent priest.

1783
01:49:27,025 --> 01:49:28,401
Get me a camera crew.

1784
01:49:28,402 --> 01:49:30,111
Tell the first squad
to meet me fully armed.

1785
01:49:30,112 --> 01:49:30,945
Yes, sir.

1786
01:49:30,946 --> 01:49:34,283
My love, the Situation Room
is yours. Till we meet again.

1787
01:49:38,996 --> 01:49:41,581
C3. Nasha will know
what it means.

1788
01:49:41,582 --> 01:49:42,958
It's a whole thing.

1789
01:49:43,917 --> 01:49:46,837
I'm gonna get Zoco back safe.
I mean it.

1790
01:49:49,131 --> 01:49:50,465
<i>Not enough.</i>

1791
01:49:51,967 --> 01:49:53,426
What else?

1792
01:49:54,845 --> 01:49:56,762
<i>We lose Luco.</i>

1793
01:49:58,098 --> 01:49:59,223
<i>One.</i>

1794
01:49:59,224 --> 01:50:01,560
<i>Be fair.</i>

1795
01:50:02,603 --> 01:50:05,856
Be fair? Like we have
to contribute a death?

1796
01:50:07,274 --> 01:50:08,317
<i>Yes.</i>

1797
01:50:09,484 --> 01:50:10,652
<i>Fair.</i>

1798
01:50:11,528 --> 01:50:14,864
<i>One of yours. Die.</i>

1799
01:50:14,865 --> 01:50:18,576
So, if we bring back Zoco safe,
and a human dies...

1800
01:50:18,577 --> 01:50:21,705
<i>Peace.</i>

1801
01:50:37,012 --> 01:50:37,930
Drive.

1802
01:50:52,027 --> 01:50:53,319
You hear me?

1803
01:50:53,320 --> 01:50:55,614
Camera crew, unit three,
do you copy?

1804
01:50:56,448 --> 01:50:58,950
Okay, the radio signal's
a little patchy right now,

1805
01:50:58,951 --> 01:51:01,702
so the car speaker will be
our direct line of comms.

1806
01:51:01,703 --> 01:51:03,705
Unit two, do you copy?

1807
01:51:04,081 --> 01:51:07,542
Our orders are to safely escort
Commander Marshall--

1808
01:51:07,543 --> 01:51:13,215
No one told you to shoot!
Do not agitate the creepers!

1809
01:51:13,882 --> 01:51:16,844
Pipe down.
We're not here to film you.

1810
01:51:22,432 --> 01:51:23,641
Really great.

1811
01:51:23,642 --> 01:51:25,726
Okay, right after your speech, sir,

1812
01:51:25,727 --> 01:51:27,520
we'll close the canopy at once,

1813
01:51:27,521 --> 01:51:31,148
and that'll be the signal for
the air squad to spray that gas.

1814
01:51:31,149 --> 01:51:33,485
Glorious annihilation, sir.

1815
01:51:36,113 --> 01:51:38,239
You. Yes, you. Come here,
what's your name? Matthew?

1816
01:51:38,240 --> 01:51:42,201
Oh, Matthew, you have the face
of an angel. Here, try my sauce.

1817
01:51:42,202 --> 01:51:44,453
There you go.
Tell me what you think.

1818
01:51:44,454 --> 01:51:45,580
Oh! Nasha!

1819
01:51:46,790 --> 01:51:48,959
No! No! Stop!

1820
01:51:49,501 --> 01:51:52,462
Hold! She's primed
for spinal fracture.

1821
01:51:52,588 --> 01:51:55,798
I'm gonna break this bitch's neck.

1822
01:51:55,799 --> 01:51:58,760
No, no, no.
Take it easy. Take it easy.

1823
01:52:00,762 --> 01:52:02,388
One snap and it's instant death.

1824
01:52:05,559 --> 01:52:07,186
Nasha Barridge,
what do you want?

1825
01:52:08,103 --> 01:52:12,065
The baby. We have to
take it to the mama.

1826
01:52:12,566 --> 01:52:14,193
- That's all?
- Yes.

1827
01:52:14,651 --> 01:52:16,153
Guarantee us a safe exit.

1828
01:52:16,904 --> 01:52:19,071
Unless you wanna
see me break her neck.

1829
01:52:20,365 --> 01:52:22,742
No. Nasha, please don't.

1830
01:52:22,743 --> 01:52:25,870
Look, we secure Nasha's exit,
as negotiated.

1831
01:52:25,871 --> 01:52:28,123
Nasha, can you release her carefully?

1832
01:52:30,459 --> 01:52:32,461
I'm gonna get the baby.
Be careful.

1833
01:52:33,003 --> 01:52:33,836
Nasha, are you okay?

1834
01:52:33,837 --> 01:52:35,880
I need to hurry.
Can I get a flitter?

1835
01:52:35,881 --> 01:52:37,841
I doubt it. You'll have to run.

1836
01:52:47,100 --> 01:52:48,684
Arrest that fucking bitch!

1837
01:52:48,685 --> 01:52:51,145
Ma'am, today you
and the commander have displayed

1838
01:52:51,146 --> 01:52:52,522
an impressive range of verbal

1839
01:52:52,523 --> 01:52:54,774
and physical abuse
and acts of cruelty

1840
01:52:54,775 --> 01:52:56,317
that far exceed
your granted authority.

1841
01:52:56,318 --> 01:52:58,987
You wanna be executed
for mutiny?

1842
01:52:59,112 --> 01:53:00,738
All video evidence of abuse

1843
01:53:00,739 --> 01:53:02,991
will be presented to the
Committee for review.

1844
01:53:03,116 --> 01:53:05,701
I suggest you have answers
prepared for your hearing.

1845
01:53:05,702 --> 01:53:07,663
Thanks, Zeke.

1846
01:53:08,497 --> 01:53:10,290
Maintain control onsite.

1847
01:53:19,424 --> 01:53:22,260
When we're within 100 feet
of the Mama Creeper, sir,

1848
01:53:22,261 --> 01:53:25,179
we'll start
slowly circling the creature.

1849
01:53:25,180 --> 01:53:27,348
That'll be the cue
to begin your final speech.

1850
01:53:27,349 --> 01:53:28,099
Yes.

1851
01:53:28,100 --> 01:53:31,019
The other camera will track
alongside you from the outside,

1852
01:53:31,144 --> 01:53:34,398
making the scene
absolutely spectacular, sir.

1853
01:53:35,941 --> 01:53:38,861
I'll keep my speech
short and tight.

1854
01:53:39,528 --> 01:53:42,614
A marvelous address.
No need to edit.

1855
01:53:43,240 --> 01:53:45,366
And then I blow up the Mickeys.

1856
01:53:45,367 --> 01:53:46,659
<i>Un bouquet final.</i>

1857
01:53:46,660 --> 01:53:48,244
You can do this, Nasha.

1858
01:53:48,245 --> 01:53:49,537
We'll get things
under control inside.

1859
01:53:49,538 --> 01:53:50,581
- Open the gate.
- Okay.

1860
01:53:51,748 --> 01:53:53,208
- See ya.
- Good luck!

1861
01:54:00,340 --> 01:54:01,966
Nasha's gonna
figure this all out.

1862
01:54:01,967 --> 01:54:03,635
Zoco will be back safe.

1863
01:54:04,720 --> 01:54:05,804
Who is that?

1864
01:54:06,763 --> 01:54:07,806
Who's coming?

1865
01:54:12,186 --> 01:54:13,395
Oh, shit.

1866
01:54:40,047 --> 01:54:41,340
Wow.

1867
01:54:44,468 --> 01:54:45,135
Wait.

1868
01:54:46,094 --> 01:54:47,679
What is this bullshit?

1869
01:54:49,932 --> 01:54:51,725
Which one's the mama?

1870
01:54:53,060 --> 01:54:55,269
What the fuck
am I supposed to be looking at

1871
01:54:55,270 --> 01:54:57,064
when I make my speech?

1872
01:54:59,149 --> 01:55:01,485
I was gonna send them off
with some dignity.

1873
01:55:02,361 --> 01:55:04,821
Now those barbarians can fuck off!

1874
01:55:06,281 --> 01:55:08,909
- Is that bazooka ready?
- Yes, sir. Loading now.

1875
01:55:09,535 --> 01:55:12,204
We're gonna blast
that mama bitch into oblivion.

1876
01:55:12,621 --> 01:55:14,373
Who needs a fucking speech?

1877
01:55:15,874 --> 01:55:17,542
I'll go hard, honey.

1878
01:55:17,543 --> 01:55:19,837
That's the mama there, sir,
can you see it?

1879
01:55:19,962 --> 01:55:21,796
It has a different shape.

1880
01:55:21,797 --> 01:55:23,757
Yes, it's her. Aim!

1881
01:55:25,843 --> 01:55:27,802
It's not her, dumbass!

1882
01:55:27,803 --> 01:55:28,803
Sorry, sir.

1883
01:55:35,185 --> 01:55:36,603
Mickey!

1884
01:55:37,896 --> 01:55:40,691
Nasha! Nasha!

1885
01:55:46,071 --> 01:55:47,238
Mickey?

1886
01:56:08,594 --> 01:56:09,970
Time to say goodbye.

1887
01:56:11,013 --> 01:56:12,139
What?

1888
01:56:23,692 --> 01:56:26,320
Blast at the nearest pile!

1889
01:56:26,695 --> 01:56:30,615
Tear through them all until
we get to the mama. Smash them!

1890
01:56:30,616 --> 01:56:33,868
Camera, make sure
to get the blood and guts.

1891
01:56:33,869 --> 01:56:36,413
Wait. That one there.

1892
01:56:36,997 --> 01:56:38,915
Shoot that one first.
It's bigger.

1893
01:56:38,916 --> 01:56:40,041
Fire!

1894
01:56:40,042 --> 01:56:41,375
- Fire now!
- Yes, sir.

1895
01:56:45,506 --> 01:56:46,465
Fire!

1896
01:56:47,466 --> 01:56:48,799
No, sir, the bomb vest!

1897
01:56:48,800 --> 01:56:50,468
Head shot, you fucking idiot!

1898
01:56:50,469 --> 01:56:52,303
No! No, sir. It's too close!

1899
01:56:55,474 --> 01:56:59,186
Wait, sir! Stop, wait!

1900
01:57:02,022 --> 01:57:05,108
No, where-- Oh, my God.

1901
01:57:05,776 --> 01:57:07,069
Mickey!

1902
01:57:08,278 --> 01:57:10,863
Nasha! Hey!

1903
01:57:10,864 --> 01:57:13,616
I knew you would make it.
Is the baby okay?

1904
01:57:15,077 --> 01:57:16,328
No, no, no.

1905
01:57:17,329 --> 01:57:18,539
What's going on?

1906
01:57:19,373 --> 01:57:20,415
Look!

1907
01:57:22,084 --> 01:57:24,753
We have Zoco!
Nasha brought her back.

1908
01:57:24,878 --> 01:57:25,963
Look.

1909
01:57:33,011 --> 01:57:34,680
Uh, Nasha,

1910
01:57:35,806 --> 01:57:37,558
Zoco's okay, right?

1911
01:57:38,141 --> 01:57:39,476
Hey!

1912
01:57:40,435 --> 01:57:41,645
Are you seeing this?

1913
01:57:44,314 --> 01:57:47,526
One human!

1914
01:58:08,463 --> 01:58:10,174
You're also afraid.

1915
01:58:13,010 --> 01:58:14,511
We're both afraid.

1916
01:58:15,637 --> 01:58:19,223
Yeah, I'm afraid.

1917
01:58:19,224 --> 01:58:20,893
It means you're human.

1918
01:58:22,811 --> 01:58:24,062
You're important.

1919
01:58:25,647 --> 01:58:27,524
Come to me, my boy.

1920
01:59:19,743 --> 01:59:20,869
{\an8}<i>Okay, guys...</i>

1921
01:59:21,286 --> 01:59:25,873
Guys, don't be shy. If you could
sit down. Take your seats.

1922
01:59:25,874 --> 01:59:28,501
The groundbreaking ceremony
will come later,

1923
01:59:28,502 --> 01:59:30,670
but we'll start
with the Expendable stuff.

1924
01:59:30,671 --> 01:59:33,798
Mickey. Mickey,
come up to the front, mate.

1925
01:59:33,799 --> 01:59:37,553
Could someone please sit in the front row,
you fucking introverts?

1926
01:59:44,226 --> 01:59:45,935
Hello, everyone.

1927
01:59:45,936 --> 01:59:48,312
I'm Nasha Barridge,
member of the Committee.

1928
01:59:51,149 --> 01:59:52,316
After weeks of debate,

1929
01:59:52,317 --> 01:59:54,903
we have finally come
to this momentous day.

1930
01:59:55,571 --> 01:59:58,073
The day we abolish
the Expendables program.

1931
01:59:58,490 --> 02:00:00,491
I would like to thank
my fellow Committee members

1932
02:00:00,492 --> 02:00:01,450
for their support.

1933
02:00:01,451 --> 02:00:04,078
I've been really feeling the love.

1934
02:00:04,079 --> 02:00:07,456
And especially,
for fighting right to the end,

1935
02:00:07,457 --> 02:00:09,418
and persuading the Committee

1936
02:00:09,543 --> 02:00:11,545
to permanently
abolish human printing...

1937
02:00:12,462 --> 02:00:15,882
I would like to thank
our very own Mickey Barnes.

1938
02:00:17,718 --> 02:00:19,969
And to be fair,
I'm just so fucking happy

1939
02:00:19,970 --> 02:00:21,304
I get to grow old with Mickey.

1940
02:00:21,305 --> 02:00:24,307
It was really sucking
getting old by myself. Okay.

1941
02:00:26,059 --> 02:00:27,393
Despite the hours of
peaceful discussion...

1942
02:00:27,394 --> 02:00:28,478
All right.

1943
02:00:29,813 --> 02:00:30,813
So, you hit the button.

1944
02:00:30,814 --> 02:00:31,940
- Mm-hmm.
- Wait.

1945
02:00:33,025 --> 02:00:35,484
Nasha will give the signal.
You hit the button.

1946
02:00:35,485 --> 02:00:37,946
Wait. And then over there, boom.

1947
02:00:38,655 --> 02:00:41,491
Do I get up and press it or--
No, in my seat, right?

1948
02:00:41,617 --> 02:00:43,785
I honestly couldn't give a fuck.

1949
02:00:45,746 --> 02:00:48,706
Henceforth,
on Niflheim as on Earth,

1950
02:00:48,707 --> 02:00:51,960
human printing is now
permanently abolished.

1951
02:00:55,255 --> 02:00:59,634
Here today, the human printer
will be burnt to ashes

1952
02:00:59,635 --> 02:01:01,220
and erased from memory.

1953
02:01:02,012 --> 02:01:03,596
<i>Nasha's such a natural.</i>

1954
02:01:03,597 --> 02:01:07,099
<i>I think she could even run for
Committee chair next election.</i>

1955
02:01:07,100 --> 02:01:09,602
<i>Blows my mind still to think
that this amazing woman</i>

1956
02:01:09,603 --> 02:01:12,396
<i>just six months ago was rotting
with the rest of us</i>

1957
02:01:12,397 --> 02:01:13,981
<i>in that shitty prison.</i>

1958
02:01:16,527 --> 02:01:18,778
<i>The day
Marshall got blown to dust,</i>

1959
02:01:18,779 --> 02:01:21,698
<i>Ylfa went into shock
and was taken to the psych ward.</i>

1960
02:01:22,115 --> 02:01:25,326
<i>Rumors went around
that she slit her wrists there.</i>

1961
02:01:25,327 --> 02:01:27,954
<i>Everyone else involved
was shoved into jail.</i>

1962
02:01:27,955 --> 02:01:30,707
<i>And somehow lucky Timo
squeezes out on parole.</i>

1963
02:01:32,626 --> 02:01:33,877
<i>But as soon as he got out,</i>

1964
02:01:34,002 --> 02:01:35,419
<i>he spent every day
dreading the moment</i>

1965
02:01:35,420 --> 02:01:36,629
<i>he'd come face to face</i>

1966
02:01:36,630 --> 02:01:38,340
<i>with the man
who delivered the letter.</i>

1967
02:01:39,049 --> 02:01:43,720
<i>The associate of Darius Blank,
who one day finally jumped him.</i>

1968
02:01:47,140 --> 02:01:48,809
<i>It was a fight to the death.</i>

1969
02:01:49,852 --> 02:01:51,019
<i>In the end,</i>

1970
02:01:51,728 --> 02:01:54,731
<i>the associate
became, uh, cycler soup.</i>

1971
02:01:57,442 --> 02:01:59,111
<i>Except for one ear.</i>

1972
02:02:01,029 --> 02:02:04,740
<i>Even at the trial,
Timo chooses to represent himself.</i>

1973
02:02:06,201 --> 02:02:08,494
As he had his grip on me,
he brought his knife around

1974
02:02:08,495 --> 02:02:11,080
to my mid-section right here,
and he sliced...

1975
02:02:11,081 --> 02:02:14,375
<i>And he got
released on self-defense.</i>

1976
02:02:14,376 --> 02:02:15,878
<i>Classic Timo.</i>

1977
02:02:16,503 --> 02:02:19,380
<i>But our trials on the other
hand, were never-ending.</i>

1978
02:02:19,381 --> 02:02:21,841
Damien, sit down! Sit down!

1979
02:02:21,842 --> 02:02:25,511
<i>Became a whole political fight
between all the pro-Marshalls</i>

1980
02:02:25,512 --> 02:02:28,097
<i>and the anti-Marshalls.</i>

1981
02:02:28,098 --> 02:02:30,933
<i>But by then,
Nasha had made up her mind.</i>

1982
02:02:30,934 --> 02:02:34,187
<i>She'd overhaul the Committee,
and change it herself.</i>

1983
02:02:34,188 --> 02:02:37,858
<i>So after she got out, she really
did run in the election.</i>

1984
02:02:38,817 --> 02:02:41,069
<i>And she won in a landslide.</i>

1985
02:02:42,404 --> 02:02:44,405
<i>On her first day in the assembly,</i>

1986
02:02:44,406 --> 02:02:47,117
<i>Nasha was so cool
about the whole thing.</i>

1987
02:02:49,161 --> 02:02:51,747
<i>I was very, very nervous.</i>

1988
02:02:52,247 --> 02:02:54,249
<i>I don't think
she really noticed, though.</i>

1989
02:02:56,251 --> 02:03:00,339
Mickey. I've got the upgraded translator.
Just came out.

1990
02:03:03,926 --> 02:03:06,385
Okay, let's be fair,
can I ask you a question?

1991
02:03:08,347 --> 02:03:09,264
<i>Go.</i>

1992
02:03:09,890 --> 02:03:11,475
What you said before,

1993
02:03:11,975 --> 02:03:15,937
about extinction and all that,
when you were all like...

1994
02:03:18,315 --> 02:03:20,734
...and like screeching
and everything.

1995
02:03:21,610 --> 02:03:22,611
Mmm.

1996
02:03:24,196 --> 02:03:27,823
Would that really
make our brains explode?

1997
02:03:27,824 --> 02:03:29,868
From like the pitch?

1998
02:03:32,287 --> 02:03:33,829
<i>Explode.</i>

1999
02:03:33,830 --> 02:03:35,457
But you said...

2000
02:03:35,874 --> 02:03:40,045
...that our eyeballs
would explode.

2001
02:03:40,879 --> 02:03:43,841
Mmm. Why not our eardrums?

2002
02:03:44,341 --> 02:03:46,635
'Cause it's like sound.

2003
02:03:49,429 --> 02:03:51,389
<i>All explode.</i>

2004
02:03:51,390 --> 02:03:53,308
Really?

2005
02:03:53,976 --> 02:03:56,812
Well, can you try it right here?
Right now?

2006
02:04:13,871 --> 02:04:16,290
<i>Who said
bluffing was only for humans?</i>

2007
02:04:16,832 --> 02:04:19,376
<i>Gotta love that, uh, poker face.</i>

2008
02:04:20,210 --> 02:04:23,046
<i>Yeah and nice burp, too.</i>

2009
02:05:28,445 --> 02:05:30,239
Uh, hello.

2010
02:05:30,864 --> 02:05:34,242
What are you doing here?
In the middle of the night.

2011
02:05:34,243 --> 02:05:37,745
Well, I just...

2012
02:05:37,746 --> 02:05:39,705
I thought you were
in the hospital all this time.

2013
02:05:39,706 --> 02:05:41,457
Hey, watch it. Look down.

2014
02:05:41,458 --> 02:05:43,585
Don't step on it.

2015
02:05:46,547 --> 02:05:49,423
It's a priceless delicacy, that.

2016
02:05:49,424 --> 02:05:51,676
Go on. Take a dab.

2017
02:05:51,677 --> 02:05:53,262
Have a taste.

2018
02:05:56,306 --> 02:05:59,267
Oh, what? Now you're too good
for sauce off the floor?

2019
02:05:59,268 --> 02:06:01,185
You think anyone else
would allow scum like you

2020
02:06:01,186 --> 02:06:02,688
to taste something so refined?

2021
02:06:03,647 --> 02:06:06,357
What is-- What is it made of?

2022
02:06:06,358 --> 02:06:09,527
Rude! Not how it works.

2023
02:06:09,528 --> 02:06:13,656
A taste of faith comes first,
then I tell you what's in it.

2024
02:06:13,657 --> 02:06:15,408
Mickey, you don't think
I'm letting you taste this

2025
02:06:15,409 --> 02:06:18,452
out of some high regard
for your palate, do you?

2026
02:06:18,453 --> 02:06:20,288
It's the opposite.

2027
02:06:20,289 --> 02:06:22,456
A true masterpiece
would be a sauce

2028
02:06:22,457 --> 02:06:25,502
that could appeal to even
an ignorant cretin like you.

2029
02:06:33,969 --> 02:06:35,261
Whatever. Fuck it.

2030
02:06:35,262 --> 02:06:36,971
Taste it, waste it, I don't care.

2031
02:06:36,972 --> 02:06:38,306
You're worthless now.

2032
02:06:38,307 --> 02:06:41,392
Much better to bring back
my usual taster,

2033
02:06:41,393 --> 02:06:45,104
the supreme one
with an actually refined palate.

2034
02:06:47,357 --> 02:06:49,526
Wait, that's...

2035
02:06:51,028 --> 02:06:54,072
Even his kidneys
are more handsome than you.

2036
02:06:57,743 --> 02:07:00,369
Not this. It can't be.

2037
02:07:04,291 --> 02:07:05,751
Of course it can.

2038
02:07:06,460 --> 02:07:09,004
Admit it, it's what you want.

2039
02:07:09,129 --> 02:07:12,758
It's what everyone wants.

2040
02:07:13,800 --> 02:07:15,385
Hey Ylfa.

2041
02:07:17,137 --> 02:07:19,056
I just remembered.

2042
02:07:22,142 --> 02:07:25,854
You died the day after Marshall.

2043
02:07:44,790 --> 02:07:47,543
Go ahead, touch me.

2044
02:07:49,253 --> 02:07:52,089
See if I'm ghost or human.

2045
02:07:56,677 --> 02:08:01,222
<i>Ever since I was a kid,
I've had scary dreams.</i>

2046
02:08:01,223 --> 02:08:03,642
<i>This time I wasn't scared.</i>

2047
02:08:04,351 --> 02:08:05,853
<i>I just thought to myself,</i>

2048
02:08:06,478 --> 02:08:08,355
<i>"What would 18 do?"</i>

2049
02:08:09,773 --> 02:08:11,107
Fuck off.

2050
02:08:12,442 --> 02:08:14,193
What are you doing?
Press the button.

2051
02:08:14,194 --> 02:08:16,321
Mickey. Press it.

2052
02:08:17,739 --> 02:08:18,782
Do it.

2053
02:08:27,916 --> 02:08:29,877
<i>I am glad the printer's gone,</i>

2054
02:08:30,043 --> 02:08:32,336
<i>but a part of me
can't help feeling guilty</i>

2055
02:08:32,337 --> 02:08:36,424
<i>that I didn't let all the other Mickeys
have a chance at life.</i>

2056
02:08:36,425 --> 02:08:38,384
<i>But I have to stop feeling guilty.</i>

2057
02:08:38,385 --> 02:08:39,845
Mickey!

2058
02:08:40,179 --> 02:08:42,347
<i>It's okay for me to be happy.</i>
